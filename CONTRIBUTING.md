# Contributing

If you haven't already read through them, we recommend the starting with the
[Azure contribution guidelines][azure-oss].

## Legal

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this
agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted
change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being
submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.azure.com/)
before submitting a pull request. This process is automated and should be
painless.

## Housekeeping

Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do.
* Be based on a reasonably recent commit in the `master` branch.

## Be nice

We might be slower than you'd like. We might also ask you to make changes to the
pull request. We ask for your patience. :smiley:
