# This should match the `title` text above

[!INCLUDE [header](../_includes/header.md)]

Your article can have only one H1 heading (#), which is this article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a succinct descriptive paragraph that informs the reader what the article is about and how it can help them. Do not start the article with a note or tip. Replace this text, and other descriptive text, with your descriptive paragraph.

This template is specific to Cloud Design Patterns. Your article should describe the problem that the pattern addresses, identify considerations for applying the pattern, and provide an example based on Microsoft Azure. Most of the patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure. Your article should be broken down into six subheadings (H2, ## in markdown)--Context and problem, Solution, Issues and considerations, When to use this pattern, Example, and Related guidance. The H2 headings and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###).

## Context and problem

Provide a brief background on the specific pattern and the problem that the pattern addresses.

## Solution

Describe the solution for the problem identified in the **Context and problem** section. If there are multiple solutions, put them in order of complexity and provide instructions on how the reader can choose the best solution for their given problem. Best practices are to provide a step-by-step approach to implement the solution, and to include screenshots to help guide the reader.


## Issues and considerations

Highlight pertinent concerns relevant to implementing the solution provided in the previous section. Best practices are to start this section with the following boilerplate sentence, followed by a bulleted list of topics for the reader to contemplate prior to implementing the given solution.

Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3


## When to use this pattern

Deliver specific guidance on when this pattern should and should not be used. Use the following boilerplate text, followed by bullet points, to help the reader determine if the solution is applicable to their specific scenario.

Use this pattern when:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

This pattern might not be suitable:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3


## Example

Include a working sample that shows the reader how the pattern solution is used in a real-world situation. The sample should be specific and provide code snippets when appropriate.

## Related guidance

Provide links to other topics that provide additional information about the pattern covered in the article. Topics can include links to pages that provide additional context for the pattern discussed in the article or links to pages that may be useful in a next-steps context. Use the following boilerplate sentence followed by a bulleted list.

The following information may be relevant when implementing this pattern:
