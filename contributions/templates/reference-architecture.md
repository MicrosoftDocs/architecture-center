# Article Title
[!INCLUDE [header](../../_includes/header.md)]

_Your article can have only one **H1 heading (#)**, which is the article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a succinct descriptive paragraph that informs the reader what the article is about and how it can help them. If the topic warrants additional explanation, you can use multiple paragraphs. Do not start the article with a note or tip. Descriptive text always appears in italics. Descriptive text should be deleted or replaced with your text prior to publication._

_This template is specific to **Reference Architectures**, a set of recommended architectures for Azure. Each architecture includes recommended practices, along with considerations for scalability, availability, manageability, and security. Most also include a deployable solution. Your article should be broken down into eight subheadings (H2, ## in markdown)--Architecture diagram, Recommendations, Scalability considerations, Availability considerations, Manageability considerations, Security considerations, Solution deployment, and Next steps. The H2 headings and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###)._

_**Completing the metadata:**_
_This section provides guidance on completing the metadata section at the top of this template. Update the placeholder text based on the following guidance:_
- _**title:** Use the H1 (#) title of your article from the top of this section. Both titles should be identical. Maximum recommended length is 60 characters._
- _**description:** Provide a brief summary of your article. This is the description that appears in search engine results, so ensure the summary is clear and concise and attracts your intended audience. Maximum recommended length is 150-160 characters._
- _**keywords:** Add a comma-separated list of key concepts and terms from your article. These are the words your intended audience will submit in a search engine._
- _**ms.date:** Enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, as shown in the metadata field. Initially this should be the date your article is published. After publication, this field should be refreshed whenever the article is updated so readers can see that the content is fresh._
- _**pnp.series.title:** Identity Management is always the correct patterns and practices series title for this template. Do not change._
- _**pnp.pattern.categories:** Review the bracketed list that follows and delete all categories that don't apply to your article: [availability, data-management, design-implementation, messaging, management-monitoring, performance-scalability, resiliency, security]. Copy and paste the final bracketed list into the metadata section._

## Architecture diagram

_Provide a screenshot that highlights the important components in the architecture. Best practices are to include a link to a downloadable Visio document in the Microsoft Download Center (boilerplate text provided). You should also include a paragraph that identifies the components in the screenshot and describes how the screenshot is relevant to the article._

A Visio document that includes this architecture diagram is available for download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

## Recommendations

_Give specific recommendations on how the reader can best deploy the architecture in the given environment. Start your recommendations after the boilerplate text that follows._

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.


## Scalability considerations

_Identify and address scalability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._


## Availability considerations

_Identify and address availability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._


## Manageability considerations

_Identify and address manageability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Security considerations

_Identify and address security concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Solution deployment

_Describe a step-by-step process for implementing the reference architecture solution. Best practices are to add the solution to GitHub, provide a link (use boilerplate text below), and explain how to roll out the solution._

A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations and considerations is available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

2. Second step
3. Third step ...

## Next steps

_Include several concrete, action-oriented steps and links to the next logical piece of content to keep the reader engaged._
