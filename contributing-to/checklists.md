# Contributing to Checklists

## Recommend structure

An item in a checklist should include these elements:

1. A concise actionable statement.
2. An explanation of why the statement is relevant to the domain of the checklist.
3. A recommendation for how to address the statement.
4. A list of additional related resources.

## Example

``` markdown
### Ensure that all checklist items are consistent

A consistent structure helps readers better navigate the guidance. By applying these rules to all checklist items we maintain a higher level of quality. The standard structure makes it easier for others to contribute.

_We recommend using the standard format for all checklist items. If an item doesn't fit the structure, exceptions should be discussed and approved by the content development team._
