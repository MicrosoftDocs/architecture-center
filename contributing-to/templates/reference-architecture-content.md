## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Thing 1**. Description

- **Thing 2**. Description

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

_Include considerations for deploying or configuring the elements of this architecture._

## Scalability considerations

_Identify and address scalability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Availability considerations

_Identify and address availability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Manageability considerations

_Identify and address manageability concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Security considerations

_Identify and address security concerns relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Deploy the solution

_Describe a step-by-step process for implementing the reference architecture solution. Best practices are to add the solution to GitHub, provide a link (use boilerplate text below), and explain how to roll out the solution._

A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations and considerations is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/path-to-repo).
