# Article Title

_Your article can have only one **H1 heading (#)**, which is the article title. The H1 heading is always followed by a succinct descriptive paragraph that informs the reader what the article is about and how it can help them. Do not start the article with a note or tip. Descriptive text always appears in italics. Descriptive text should be deleted or replaced with your text prior to publication._

_This template is specific to **Cloud Design Patterns**. Your article should describe the problem that the pattern addresses, identify considerations for applying the pattern, and provide an example based on Microsoft Azure. Most of the patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure. Your article should be broken down into six subheadings (H2, ## in markdown)--Context and problem, Solution, Issues and considerations, When to use this pattern, Example, and Next steps. The H2 headings and descriptions are included in this template. If you need to create a new heading under one of the H2 headings, use an H3 heading (###)._

_**Completing the metadata:**_
_This section provides guidance on completing the metadata section at the top of this template. Update the placeholder text based on the following guidance:_

- _**title:** Use the H1 (#) title of your article from the top of this section. Both titles should be identical. Maximum recommended length is 60 characters._
- _**description:** Provide a brief summary of your article. This is the description that appears in search engine results, so ensure the summary is clear and concise and attracts your intended audience. Maximum recommended length is 150-160 characters._
- _**keywords:** Add a comma-separated list of key concepts and terms from your article. These are the words your intended audience will submit in a search engine._
- _**ms.date:** Enter the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, as shown in the metadata field. Initially this should be the date your article is published. After publication, this field should be refreshed whenever the article is updated so readers can see that the content is fresh._
- _**pnp.series.title:** Cloud Design Patterns is always the correct patterns and practices series title for this template. Do not change._
- _**pnp.pattern.categories:** Review the bracketed list that follows and delete all categories that don't apply to your article: [availability, data-management, design-implementation, messaging, management-monitoring, performance-scalability, resiliency, security]. Copy and paste the final bracketed list into the metadata section._

## Context and problem

_Provide a brief background on the specific pattern and the problem that the pattern addresses._

## Solution

_Describe the solution for the problem identified in the **Context and problem** section. If there are multiple solutions, put them in order of complexity and provide instructions on how the reader can choose the best solution for their given problem. Best practices are to provide a step-by-step approach to implement the solution, and to include screenshots to help guide the reader._

## Issues and considerations

_Highlight pertinent concerns relevant to implementing the solution provided in the previous section. Best practices are to start this section with the following boilerplate sentence, followed by a bulleted list of topics for the reader to contemplate prior to implementing the given solution._

Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## When to use this pattern

_Deliver specific guidance on when this pattern should and should not be used. Use the following boilerplate text, followed by bullet points, to help the reader determine if the solution is applicable to their specific scenario._

- Item 3

This pattern might not be suitable:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Example

_Include a working sample that shows the reader how the pattern solution is used in a real-world situation. The sample should be specific and provide code snippets when appropriate._

## Next steps

_Provide links to other topics that provide additional information about the pattern covered in the article. Topics can include links to pages that provide additional context for the pattern discussed in the article or links to pages that may be useful in a next-steps context.
