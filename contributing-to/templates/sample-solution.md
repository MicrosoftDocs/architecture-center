# Article Title

The title is a noun phrase that describes the scenario.

> Example: "Insurance claim image classification on Azure"

Avoid naming the scenario after the Azure technologies that are used.

<Introductory section (no heading)>

> This should be an introduction of the business problem and why this scenario was built to solve it.
>> What industry is the customer in?  
>> What prompted them to solve the problem?  
>> What services were used in building out this solution?
>> What does this example scenario show? What are the customer's goals?  

> What were the benefits of implementing the solution described blow?

## Potential use cases

> Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?  
> How similar or different are they to what's in this article?

These other uses cases have similar design patterns:

* List of example use cases

## Architecture

*Architecture Diagram goes here*

> What does the solution look like at a high level?  
> Why did we build the solution this way?  
> What will the customer need to bring to this?  (Software, skills, etc?)  
> Is there a data flow that should be described?

### Components

A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product documentation.

> Why is each component there?  
> What does it do and why was it necessary?

* Example: [Resource Groups][resource-groups] is a logical container for Azure resources.  We use resource groups to organize everything related to this project in the Azure console.

### Alternatives

Use this section to talk about alternative Azure services or architectures that you might consider for this solution. Include the reasons why you might choose these alternatives.

> What alternative technologies were considered and why didn't we use them?

## Considerations

> Are there any lessons learned from running this that would be helpful for new customers?  What went wrong when building it out?  What went right?

### Availability, Scalability, and Security

> How do I need to think about managing, maintaining, and monitoring this long term?

> Are there any size considerations around this specific solution?  
> What scale does this work at?  
> At what point do things break or not make sense for this architecture?

> Are there any security considerations (past the typical) that I should know about this?

## Deploy this scenario


> (Optional if it doesn't make sense)
>
> Is there an example deployment that can show me this in action?  What would I need to change to run this in production?

## Pricing

> How much will this cost to run?  
> Are there ways I could save cost?  
> If it scales linearly, than we should break it down by cost/unit.  If it does not, why?  
> What are the components that make up the cost?  
> How does scale effect the cost?
> 
> Link to the pricing calculator with all of the components in the architecture included, even if they're a $0 or $1 usage.  
> If it makes sense, include a small/medium/large configurations.  Describe what needs to be changed as you move to larger sizes

## Next Steps

> Where should I go next if I want to start building this?  
> Are there any reference architectures that help me build this?

## Related Resources

> Are there any relevant case studies or customers doing something similar?
> Is there any other documentation that might be useful?  
> Are there product documents that go into more detail on specific technologies not already linked
