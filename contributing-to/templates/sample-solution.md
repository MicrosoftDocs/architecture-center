# Article Title

> This should be an introduction of the business problem and why this scenario was built to solve it.

This is a business problem that needs to be solved in this industry.  This solution solves this problem by doing this.

## Potential use cases

> Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?  How similar or different are they to what's in this article?

These other uses cases have similar design patterns:

* List of example use cases

## Architecture

*Architecture Diagram goes here*

> What does the solution look like at a high level?
>
> Why did we build the solution this way?
>
> What will the customer need to bring to this?  (Software, skills, etc?)



### Components

> Why is each component there? What does it do and why was it necessary?

* List of components with links to documentation.

* [Resource Groups][resource-groups] is a logical container for Azure resources.

### Alternatives

> What alternative technologies were considered and why didn't we use them?

## Considerations

> Are there any lessons learned from running this that would be helpful for new customers?  What went wrong when building it out?  What went right?

### Availability

> How do I need to think about managing, maintaining, and monitoring this long term?

### Scalability

> Are there any size considerations around this specific solution?
> 
> What scale does this work at?  At what point do things break or not make sense for this architecture?

### Security

> Are there any security considerations (past the typical) that I should know about this?

## Deploy this scenario

> (Optional if it doesn't make sense)
>
> Is there an example deployment that can show me this in action?  What would I need to change to run this in production?


## Pricing

> How much will this cost to run?
> 
> Are there ways I could save cost?
> 
> If it scales linearly, than we should break it down by cost/unit.  If it does not, why?


We have provided three sample cost profiles based on amount of traffic you expect to get:

* [Small][small-pricing]: describe what a small implementation is.
* [Medium][medium-pricing]: describe what a medium implementation is.
* [Large][large-pricing]: describe what a large implementation is.

## Next Steps & Related Resources

> Where should I go next if I want to start building this?
> 
> Are there any relevant case studies or customers doing something similar?
