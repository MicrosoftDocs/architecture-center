## Data residency

Data residency is a particular issue that businesses face as they move more and more information into the cloud. The cloud provides flexibility for data storage, file sharing and the use of different SaaS applications, but it presents challenges when it comes to establishing and maintaining data control. It is having clear control over their data that businesses need to be able to prove in order to meet internal and customer requirements, standards and legal obligations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
