ms.assessment_question: Ensure that no single user account has access to both production and backup data.

## Ensure that no single user account has access to both production and backup data.

Your data backups are compromised if one single user account has permission to write to both production and backup sources. A malicious user could purposely delete all your data, while a regular user could accidentally delete it. Design your application to limit the permissions of each user account so that only the users that require write access have write access and it's only to either production or backup, but not both.
