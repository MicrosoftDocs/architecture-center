## Logging and auditing

Use VSTS release management for end-to-end traceability. Utilize VSTS history and auditing for a consolidated view of changes to code and infrastructure.

To capture as much version-specific information as possible, implement a robust logging strategy. If you use staged deployment techniques, more than one version of your application will be running in production. If a problem occurs, determine which version is causing it.
