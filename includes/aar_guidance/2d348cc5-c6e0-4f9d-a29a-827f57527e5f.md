ms.assessment_question: Implemented the "Circuit Breaker" pattern to prevent cascading failures

## Cascading Failures

The [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker#related-patterns-and-guidance) provides stability while the system recovers from a failure and minimizes the impact on performance. It can help to maintain the response time of the system by quickly rejecting a request for an operation that's likely to fail, rather than waiting for the operation to time out, or never return.

[Retry pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry). Describes how an application can handle anticipated temporary failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource by transparently retrying an operation that has previously failed.

[Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring). A circuit breaker might be able to test the health of a service by sending a request to an endpoint exposed by the service. The service should return information indicating its status.
