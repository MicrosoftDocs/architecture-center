## Encrypt virtual disk files

Virtual machines use virtual disk files as virtual storage volumes and exist in
a cloud service providerâ€™s blob storage system. These files can be moved from
on-premises to cloud systems, from cloud systems to on-premises, or between
cloud systems. Due to the mobility of these files, you need to make sure the
files and their contents are not accessible to unauthorized users.

Authentication-based access controls should be in place to prevent potential
attackers from downloading the files to their own systems. In the event of a
flaw in the authentication and authorization system or its configuration, you
want to have a backup mechanism to secure the virtual disk files.

You can encrypt the virtual disk files to help prevent attackers from gaining
access to the contents of the disk files in the event that an attacker is able
to download the files. When attackers attempt to mount an encrypted disk file,
they will not be able to because of the encryption.

We recommend that you enable virtual disk encryption.

An example of virtual disk encryption is [Azure Disk
Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption-overview).
