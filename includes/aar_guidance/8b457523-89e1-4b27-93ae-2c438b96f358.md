## Passwordless Or multi-factor authentication

All users should be converted to use passwordless authentication or multi-factor
authentication (MFA) over time. The details of this recommendation are in the
administration section [Passwordless Or multi-factor authentication for admins](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#passwordless-or-multi-factor-authentication-for-admins) FOR
ADMINS. The same recommendation applies to all users, but should be applied first
and strongest to accounts with administrative privileges.

You can also reduce use of passwords by applications using [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to grant access to resources in Azure
