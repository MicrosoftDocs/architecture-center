ms.assessment_question: Virtual machines are protected from corruption and accidental deletion
---
## Backup VMs

To protect Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) from application errors or accidental deletion, use [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/). Azure Backup enables the creation of backups that are consistent across multiple VM disks. In addition, the Backup Vault can be replicated across regions to provide recovery from region loss.
