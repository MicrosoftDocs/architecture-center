## Remove Virtual Machine (VM) direct internet connectivity

Ensure policy and processes require restricting and monitoring direct internet
connectivity by virtual machines

Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports and
attempt 'easy' attacks like common passwords and known unpatched vulnerabilities

This can be accomplished with one or more methods in Azure:

-   **Enterprise-wide prevention** - Prevent inadvertent exposure with an
    enterprise network and permission model such as the reference model
    described throughout this guidance. This significantly reduces the risk of
    accidental VM internet exposure by

    -   Ensuring that network traffic is routed through approved egress points
        by default

    -   Exceptions (for example, add a public IP address to a resource) must go through
        a centralized group (which can carefully evaluate exception requests to
        ensure appropriate controls are applied)

-   **Identify and Remediate** exposed VMs using the [Azure Security
    Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-install-endpoint-protection)
    network visualization to quickly identify internet exposed resources.

-   **Restrict management ports** (RDP, SSH) using [Just in Time
    access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time)
    in Azure Security Center
