## Centralize network management and security

Centralize the organizational responsibility for management and security of core
networking functions such as cross-premises links, virtual networking,
subnetting, and IP address schemes as well as network security elements such as
virtual network appliances, encryption of cloud virtual network activity and
cross-premises traffic, network-based access controls, and other traditional
network security components.

When you centralize network management and security you reduce the potential for
inconsistent strategies that can create potential attacker exploitable security
risks. Because all divisions of the IT and development organizations do not have
the same level of network management and security knowledge and sophistication,
organizations benefit from leveraging a centralized network teamâ€™s expertise and
tooling.

[Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-network-recommendations)
can be used to help centralize the management of network security.
