## Penetration testing

Use Penetration Testing to validate security defenses.

Real world validation of security defenses is critical to validate your defense
strategy and implementation. This can be accomplished by a penetration test
(simulates a one time attack) or a red ream program (simulates a persistent
threat actor targeting your environment).

Follow the [guidance published by Microsoft](https://technet.microsoft.com/mt784683) for planning and executing simulated
attacks.
