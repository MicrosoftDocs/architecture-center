ms.assessment_question: You enforce conditional access for users
---
## Enforce conditional access for users - Zero Trust

Authentication for all users should include measurement and enforcement of key security attributes to support a Zero Trust strategy. 

Attackers compromising Azure Admin accounts can cause significant harm.
Conditional Access can significantly reduce that risk by enforcing security
hygiene before allowing access to Azure management.

Configure [Conditional Access policy for Azure management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/conditional-access-azure-management)
that meets your organizationâ€™s risk appetite and operational needs.

-   Require Multifactor Authentication and/or connection from designated work
    network

-   Require Device **integrity with Microsoft Defender ATP** (Strong Assurance)

You can also reduce use of passwords by applications using [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
to grant access to resources in Azure.
