ms.assessment_question: Health probes are implemented to validate application functionality
---
## Creating good health probes

The health and performance of an application can degrade over time, and degradation might not be noticeable until the application fails.

Implement probes or check functions, and run them regularly from outside the application. These checks can be as simple as measuring response time for the application as a whole, for individual parts of the application, for specific services that the application uses, or for separate components.

Check functions can run processes to ensure that they produce valid results, measure latency and check availability, and extract information from the system.
