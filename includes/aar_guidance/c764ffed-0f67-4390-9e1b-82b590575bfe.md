ms.assessment_question: There is an enterprise segmentation strategy in place
---
## Enterprise segmentation strategy

Identify groups of resources that can be isolated from other parts of the
enterprise to contain (and detect) adversary movement within your enterprise.
This unified enterprise segmentation strategy will guide all technical teams to
consistently segment access using networking, applications, identity, and any
other access controls.

A clear and simple segmentation strategy helps contain risk while enabling
productivity and business operations.

An enterprise segmentation strategy is defined higher than a traditional
*'network segmentation'* security strategy. Traditional segmentation approaches for on premises environments frequently failed to achieve
their goals because they were developed 'bottom-up' by different technical teams
and were not aligned well with business use cases and application workloads.
This resulted in overwhelming complexity that generates support issues and often
undermines the original purpose with broad network firewall exceptions.

Creating a unified enterprise segmentation strategy enables to guide all
technical teams stakeholders (IT, Security, Applications, etc.) Business Units
that is built around the business risks and needs will increase alignment to and
understand and support sustainability of the security containment promises.
This clarity and alignment will also reduce s the risk of human errors and
automation failures that can lead to security vulnerabilities, operational
downtime, or both.

While network micro-segmentation also offers promise to reduce risk (discussed
more in [Network Security and Containment](/azure/architecture/security/network-security-containment) section), it doesn’t eliminate the
need to align technical teams. Micro segmentation should be considered after to
and plans to ensure the ensuring technical teams are aligned so you can avoid a
recurrence of the internal conflicts that plagued and confusion of the
on-premises network generation segmentation strategies.

Here are Microsoft's recommendations for prioritizing initiatives on containment and
segmentation (based on Zero Trust principles). These recommendations are listed in priority
order by highest importance.

-  Ensure alignment of technical teams to a single enterprise segmentation
    strategy.

-  Invest in broadening containment by establishing a modern perimeter based on
    zero trust principles focused on identity, device, applications, and other
    signals (to overcome limitation of network controls to protect new resources
    and attack types).

-  Bolster network controls for legacy applications by exploring micro
    segmentation strategies.

A good enterprise segmentation strategy meets these criteria:

-   **Enables Operations** – Minimizes operation friction by aligning to
    business practices and applications

-   **Contains Risk** - Adds cost and friction to attackers by

    -   Isolating sensitive workloads from compromise of other assets

    -   Isolating high exposure systems from being used as a pivot to other
        systems

-   **Monitored** – Security Operations should monitor for potential violations
    of the integrity of the segments (account usage, unexpected traffic, etc.)
