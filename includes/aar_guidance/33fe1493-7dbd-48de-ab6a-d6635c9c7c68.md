ms.assessment_question: You have a plan for dependency failures

## Dependent service outage

For each dependent service, you should understand the implications of a service disruption and the way that the application will respond. Many services include features that support resiliency and availability, so evaluating each service independently is likely to improve your disaster recovery plan. For example, Azure Event Hubs supports [failing over](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-geo-dr#setup-and-failover-flow) to the secondary namespace.
