ms.assessment_question: You have enabled platform encryption services
---
## Enable platform encryption services

All public cloud service providers enable encryption that is done automatically
using provider-managed keys on their platform. In many cases, this is done for
the customer and no user interaction is required. In other cases, the provider
makes this an option that the customer can choose to use or not to use.

There is almost no overhead in enabling this type of encryption as itâ€™s managed
by the cloud service provider.

We recommend that for each service that supports service provider encryption
that you enable that option.

An example of service-specific service provider encryption is [Azure Storage Service encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).
