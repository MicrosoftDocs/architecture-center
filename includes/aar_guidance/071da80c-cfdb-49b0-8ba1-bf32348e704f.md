ms.assessment_question: You use cloud provider identity sources for third parties
---
## Use cloud provider identity source for third parties

Use cloud identity services designed to host non-employee accounts rather than
including vendors, partners, and customers in a corporate directory.

This reduces risk by granting the appropriate level of access to external
entities instead of the full default permissions given to full-time employees.
This least privilege approach and clear clearly differentiation of external
accounts from company staff makes it easier to prevent and detect attacks coming
in from these vectors. Additionally, management of these identities is done by
the external also increases productivity by parties, reducing ingeffort required
by company HR and IT teams.

For example, these capabilities natively integrate into the same Azure AD
identity and permission model used by Azure and Office 365

-   [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/) –
    Employees and Enterprise Resources

-   [Azure AD B2B](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/)
    – Partners

-   [Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/)
    – Customers/citizens
