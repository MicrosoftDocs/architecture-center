ms.assessment_question: You take a hybrid enterprise view
---
## Hybrid enterprise view

Security operations should ensure their tooling, processes, and analyst
skillsets enable visibility across the full span of their hybrid estate.

Attackers donâ€™t restrict their actions to a particular environment when
targeting an organization, they will attack resources on any platform using any
method available. Enterprise organizations adopting cloud services like Azure
and AWS are effectively operating a hybrid of cloud and on-premises assets.

Security operations tooling and processes should be designed for attacks on
cloud and on-premises assets as well as attackers pivoting between cloud and
on-premises resources using identity or other means. This enterprise-wide view
will enable security operations teams to rapidly detect, respond, and recover
from attacks, reducing organizational risk.
