ms.assessment_question: Automatically scale when load increses

## Autoscaling

Use Autoscaling guidance. Implement autoscale for services. Autoscaling, either out/in or up/down, ensures that your application can handle additional load whilst still remaining cost efficient. It is most efficient to scale up quickly, pause, then scale down slowly.

Ensure that your application can gracefully handle scale in as well as scale out.
