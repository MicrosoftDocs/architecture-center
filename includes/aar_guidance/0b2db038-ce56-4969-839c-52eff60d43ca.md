## Visualization and alerts

Present telemetry data in a format that makes it easy for an operator to notice problems or trends quickly, such as a dashboard or email alert.

Get a full-stack view of application state by using [Azure dashboards](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards) to create a consolidated view of monitoring graphs from Application Insights, Log Analytics, Azure Monitor metrics, and Service Health. And use [Azure Monitor alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview) to create notifications on Service Health, resource health, Azure Monitor metrics, logs in Log Analytics, and Application Insights.

For more information about monitoring and diagnostics, see [Monitoring and diagnostics](../best-practices/monitoring.md).
