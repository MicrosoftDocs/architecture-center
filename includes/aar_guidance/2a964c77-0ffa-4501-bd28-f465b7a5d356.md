ms.assessment_question: You discover and replace insecure protocols
---
## Discover and replace insecure protocols

Discover and disable the use of legacy insecure protocols SMBv1, LM/NTLMv1,
wDigest, Unsigned LDAP Binds, and Weak ciphers in Kerberos.

Authentication protocols are a critical foundation of nearly all security
assurances. These older versions can be exploited by attackers with access to
your network and are often used extensively on legacy systems on Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS).

Here are ways to reduce your risk:

-  **Discover** protocol usage by reviewing logs with Azure Sentinelâ€™s Insecure
    Protocol Dashboard or third party tools

-  Restrict or Disable use of these protocols by following guidance for
    [SMB](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2696547/detect-enable-disable-smbv1-smbv2-smbv3-in-windows-and-windows-server),
    [NTLM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-ntlm-authentication-in-this-domain),
    [WDigest](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2871997/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-credentials-protection-a)

We recommend implementing changes using pilot or other testing method to
mitigate risk of operational interruption.
