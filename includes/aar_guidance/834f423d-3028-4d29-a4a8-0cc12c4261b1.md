ms.assessment_question: You synchronize your identity systems
---
## Synchronize identity systems

Synchronize your cloud identity with your existing identity systems

Consistency of identities across cloud and on-premises will reduce human errors
and resulting security risk. Teams managing resources in both environment need
a consistent authoritative source to achieve security assurances.

For Azure, synchronize Azure AD with your existing authoritative on premises
Active Directory using [Azure AD connect](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect).
This is also required for an Office 365 migration, so it is often already done
before Azure migration and development projects begin. Note that administrator
accounts should be excepted from synchronization as described in [Donâ€™t synchronize on-premises admin accounts to cloud identity providers](/azure/architecture/security/identity#dont-synchronize-on-premises-admin-accounts-to-cloud-identity-providers) and 
[Critical impact account dependencies](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#critical-impact-admin-dependencies--accountworkstation).
