ms.assessment_question: You simulate attacks against critical impact accounts
---
## Attack simulation for critical impact accounts

Regularly simulate attacks against administrative users with current attack
techniques to educate and empower them.

People are a critical part of your defense, especially your personnel with
access to critical impact accounts. Ensuring these users (and ideally all users)
have the knowledge and skills to avoid and resist attacks will reduce your
overall organizational risk.

You can use [Office 365 Attack Simulation](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/attack-simulator)
capabilities or any number of third party offerings.
