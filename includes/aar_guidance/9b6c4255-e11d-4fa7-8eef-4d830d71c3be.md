## option_title

An attack surface is the total number of points or vectors through which an attacker can try to enter an environment or network. In terms of cybersecurity, this means how a bad actor could gain access to your network to either send, extract, or encrypt data through the holes they find in a network. Every network interaction point allows for a potential network attack surface. In other words, an attack on a surface occurs when bad actors can find holes in a network which then allows them to cause disruption. This disruption can come in the forms of data breaches, ransomware, and more.
