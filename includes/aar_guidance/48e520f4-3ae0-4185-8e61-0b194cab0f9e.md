ms.assessment_question: Avoid sticky sessions and client affinity
---
## Session affinity

To design a system to be horizontally scalable, avoid designing a web application that assumes requests have instance affinity. Stateless, or non-affinity applications, allow the hosting platform (App Services, Kubernetes, Service Fabric, other) to dynamically add or remove compute instances based on service metrics. This is called auto-scale and works differently depending on the service. A critical requirement for a web application or api to work in an auto-scalable environment is a stateless nature where the application saves its state to an external data store allowing the app platform to load-balance and route requests across the any of the clustered instances. This is advantageous for service self-healing, removing problematic compute instances, and enabling the latest platform innovation that leads to higher scale. For older applications running in App Services v1 platforms, avoid using the Application Request Routing (ARR) session affinity flag to force all requests back to the initial instance.

If the solution implements a long-running task, route requests to this task with queuing mechanisms discussed earlier.
