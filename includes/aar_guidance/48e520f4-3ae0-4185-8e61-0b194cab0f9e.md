ms.assessment_question: Avoid sticky sessions and client affinity
---
## Session affinity

Avoid using Application Request Routing (ARR) Affinity, more generally known as Session Affinity or Sticky Sessions, where possible. Session affinity lessens the ability for your application to handle node failures and redistribute traffic efficiently. If storing session information is essential, consider offloading this to an external data store.
