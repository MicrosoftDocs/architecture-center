## Use Web Application Firewalls

Web application firewalls (WAFs) mitigate the risk of an attacker being able to
exploit commonly seen security vulnerabilities for applications. While not
perfect, WAFs provide a basic minimum level of security for web applications.

WAFs are an important mitigation as attackers target web applications for an
ingress point into an organization similar to a client endpoint. WAFs are
appropriate for both

-   Organizations without a strong application security program as it’s a
    critical safety measure(much like a parachute in a plane. Note that this
    shouldn’t be the only planned safety mechanism to reduce the volume and
    severity of security bugs in your applications. For details, see [Reduce security bug volume and impact](#bottom-up-approach-to-reduce-security-bug-volume-and-impact).

-   Organizations who have invested in application security as WAFs provide a
    valuable additional defense in-depth mitigation. WAFs in this case act as a
    final safety mechanism in case a security bug was missed by security
    practices in the development lifecycle.

Microsoft includes WAF capabilities in [Azure Application
Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/) and
many vendors offer these capabilities as standalone security appliances or as
part of next generation firewalls.
