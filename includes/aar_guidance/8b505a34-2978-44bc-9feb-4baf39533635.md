ms.assessment_question: You use identity based storage access controls
---
## Use identity based storage access controls

Cloud service providers make multiple methods of access control over storage
resources available. Examples include shared keys, shared signatures, anonymous
access, and identity provider-based methods.

Identify provider methods of authentication and authorization are the least
liable to compromise and enable more fine-grained role-based access controls
over storage resources.

We recommend that you use an identity-based option for storage access control.

An example of this is [Azure Active Directory Authentication to Azure blob and queue services](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-azure-active-directory).
