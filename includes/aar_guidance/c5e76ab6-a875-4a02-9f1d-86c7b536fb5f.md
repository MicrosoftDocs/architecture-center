ms.assessment_question: You have a single enterprise directory
---
## Single enterprise directory

Establish a single enterprise directory for managing identities of full-time
employees and enterprise resources

A single authoritative source for identities increases clarity and consistency
for all roles in IT and Security. This reduces security risk from human errors
and automation failures resulting from complexity. By having a single
authoritative source, teams that need to make changes to the directory can do so
in one place and have confidence that their change will take effect everywhere.

For Azure, designate a single Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instance
directory as the authoritative source for corporate/organizational accounts.
