ms.assessment_question: You regularly review critical access

## Regularly review critical access

Regularly review roles that are assigned privileges with a business-critical impact. 

Set up a recurring review pattern to ensure that accounts are removed from permissions as roles change.
You can conduct the review manually or through an automated process by using tools such as [Azure AD access reviews](/azure/active-directory/governance/create-access-review).
