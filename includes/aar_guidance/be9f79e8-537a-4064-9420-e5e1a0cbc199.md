ms.assessment_question: You use cross-platform identity management
---
## Cross platform identity management

Use a single identity provider for authenticating all platforms (Windows, Linux,
and others) and cloud services.

A single identity provider for all enterprise assets will simplify management
and security, minimizing the risk of oversights or human mistakes. Deploying
multiple identity solutions (or an incomplete solution) can result in
unenforceable password policies, passwords not reset after a breach,
proliferation of passwords (often stored insecurely), and former employees
retaining passwords after termination.

For example, Azure Active Directory can be used to authenticate Windows,
[Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/login-using-aad),
Azure, Office 365, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/amazon-web-service-tutorial),
[Google Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/google-apps-tutorial),
(remote access to) [legacy on-premises applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy),
and third-party [Software as a Service providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list).
