ms.assessment_question: Use locking to ensure consistency
---
## Data Locking

When using a relational database behind an Azure hosted application, the app owners must ensure an appropriate consistency and isolation level when making database connections to achieve maximum performance and scale out. Consistency and isolation are two of the ACID database properties. Consistency is all about ensuring a transaction can rollback to a state before the transaction started. Isolation is all about ensuring an executing transaction remains isolated from other executing transactions. The settings of these ACID properties can dramatically affect the number of users that can concurrently use a cloud web application in parallel, and therefore needs to be carefully considered across the various exposed web pages and/or APIs. An excellent detail summary of these concepts in respect to Azure SQL Database can be found here. </azure/sql-database/saas-tenancy-app-design-patterns>
