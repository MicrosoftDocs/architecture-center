## Security team visibility

Provide security teams read-only access to the security aspects of all technical
resources in their purview

Security organizations require visibility into the technical environment to
perform their duties of assessing and reporting on organizational risk. Without
this visibility, security will have to rely on information provided from groups
operating the environment who have a potential conflict of interest (and other
priorities).

Note that security teams may separately be granted additional privileges if
they have operational responsibilities or a requirement to enforce
compliance on Azure resources.

For example in Azure, assign security teams to the **Security Readers**
permission that provides access to measure security risk (without providing
access to the data itself)

For enterprise security groups with broad responsibility for security of Azure,
you can assign this permission using:

-   *Root management group* – for teams responsible for assessing and reporting
    risk on all resources

-   *Segment management group(s)* – for teams with limited scope of
    responsibility (typically required because of organizational boundaries or
    regulatory requirements)

Because security will have broad access to the environment (and visibility into
potentially exploitable vulnerabilities), you should consider them critical
impact accounts and apply the same protections as administrators. The [Administration](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts)
section details these controls for Azure.
