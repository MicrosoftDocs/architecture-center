## Plan for usage patterns

Identify differences in requirements during critical and non-critical periods. Are there certain critical periods when the system must be available? For example, a tax-filing application can't fail during a filing deadline and a video streaming service shouldn't lag during a live event. In these situations, weigh the cost against the risk.

- To ensure uptime and meet service-level agreements (SLAs) in critical periods, plan redundancy across several regions in case one fails, even if it costs more.
- Conversely, during non-critical periods, run your application in a single region to minimize costs.
- In some cases, you can mitigate additional expenses by using modern serverless techniques that have consumption-based billing.
