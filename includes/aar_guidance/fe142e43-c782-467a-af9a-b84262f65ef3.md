ms.assessment_question: Utilize connection pooling
---
## Connection pooling

Establishing connections to databases is typically a very expensive operation that involves establishing an authenticated network connection to the remote database server. Pooling and reusing cached connections for new database operations is a common best practice for improving both application performance and scalability. In many cases, a default pool size might only consist of a small handful of connections that performs quickly in basic test scenarios, but become a bottleneck under scale when the pool is exhausted. Establishing a pool size that maps to the number of concurrent transactions supported on each application instance is a best practice. Each database and application platform will have slightly different requirements for the right way to setup and leverage the pool. A .NET code example against SQL Server and Azure Database can be found here: </dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling>. In all cases, testing is paramount to ensure a connection pool is properly established and working as designed under load.
