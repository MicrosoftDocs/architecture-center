## Data at rest

Protecting data at rest is required to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and
availability assurances across all workloads. Storage in a cloud service like
Azure is [architected and
implemented](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/sosp-paper-windows-azure-storage-a-highly-available-cloud-storage-service-with-strong-consistency/)
quite differently than on premises solutions to enable massive scaling, modern
access through REST APIs, and isolation between tenants.

Encryption at rest provides data protection for stored data (at rest). Attacks against data at-rest include attempts to obtain physical access to the hardware on which the data is stored, and then compromise the contained data. In such an attack, a serverâ€™s hard drive may have been mishandled during maintenance allowing an attacker to remove the hard drive. Later the attacker would put the hard drive into a computer under their control to attempt to access the data.
