ms.assessment_question: You evaluate your security posture using standard benchmarks
---
## Evaluate security using benchmarks

Use an industry standard benchmark to evaluate your organizations current
security posture.

Benchmarking allows you to improve your security program by learning from
external organizations. Benchmarking lets you know how your current security
state compares to that of other organizations, providing both external
validation for successful elements of your current system as well as identifying
gaps that serve as opportunities to enrich your team’s overall security
strategy. Even if your security program isn’t tied to a specific benchmark or
regulatory standard, you will benefit from understanding the documented ideal
states by those outside and inside of your industry.

-   As an example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created security
    benchmarks for Azure that map to the CIS Control Framework. Another
    reference example is the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework that defines the various
    adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. These
    external references control mappings help you to understand any gaps between
    your current strategy what you have and what other experts in the industry.
