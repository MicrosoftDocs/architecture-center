ms.assessment_question: You have a policy in place to apply security updates to VMs and strong password requirements.
---
## Virtual Machine (VM) security updates and strong passwords

Ensure policy and processes enable (and require) rapid application of security
updates to virtual machines.

Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports and
attempt 'easy' attacks like common passwords and unpatched vulnerabilities.

Enable [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-apply-system-updates)
to identify missing security updates & apply them.

[Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46899) or a third party Privileged Access Management can set strong local admin passwords and just in time access to them.
