ms.assessment_question: You have assigned a security incident notification contact
---
## Assign incident notification contact

Ensure a security contact receives Azure incident notifications from Microsoft
typically a notification that your resource is compromised and/or attacking
another customer.

This enables your security operations team to rapidly respond to potential
security risks and remediate them.

Ensure administrator contact information in the Azure enrollment portal includes
contact information that will notify security operations (directly or rapidly
via an internal process)
