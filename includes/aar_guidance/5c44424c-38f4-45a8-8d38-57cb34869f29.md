## Request timeouts

When making a service call or a database call ensure that appropriate request timeouts are set.  Database Connection timeouts are typically set to 30s. Use guidance on troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and [transient errors for SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connectivity-issues).

Leverage design patterns that encapsulate robust timeout strategies like [Choreography pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/choreography) or [Compensating Transaction pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction).
