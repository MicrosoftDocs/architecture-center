ms.assessment_question: You don't assign users with granular or custom permissions

## Avoid granular and custom permissions

Avoid permissions that specifically reference individual resources or users

Specific permissions create unneeded complexity and confusion as they don’t
carry the intention to new similar resources. This then accumulates into a
complex legacy configuration that is difficult to maintain or change without
fear of 'breaking something' – negatively impacting both security and solution
agility.

Instead of assigning specific resource-specific permissions, use either

-   Management Groups for enterprise-wide permissions

-   Resource groups for permissions within subscriptions

Instead of granting permissions to specific users, assign access to groups in
Azure AD. If there isn’t an appropriate group, work with the identity team to
create one. This allows you to add and remove group members externally to Azure
and ensure permissions are current, while also allowing the group to be used for
other purposes such as mailing lists.
