## Failure mode analysis

Failure mode analysis (FMA) is a process for building resiliency into a system, by identifying possible failure points in the system. The FMA should be part of the architecture and design phases, so that you can build failure recovery into the system from the beginning.
*Failure mode analysis* (FMA) builds resiliency into a system by identifying possible failure points and defining how the application responds to those failures. The FMA should be part of the architecture and design phases, so failure recovery is built into the system from the beginning. The goals of an FMA are to:

- Determine what types of failures an application might experience and how the application detects those failures.
- Capture the potential effects of each type of failure and determine how the app responds.
- Plan for logging and monitoring the failure and identify recovery strategies.

Here are some examples of failure modes and detection strategies for a specific failure point &mdash; a call to an external web service:

| Failure mode           | Detection strategy           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Service is unavailable | HTTP 5xx                     |
| Throttling             | HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) |
| Authentication         | HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)      |
| Slow response          | Request times out            |
