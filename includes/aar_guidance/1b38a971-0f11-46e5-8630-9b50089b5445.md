ms.assessment_question: You block legacy authentication
---
## Block legacy authentication

Disable insecure legacy protocols for internet-facing services.

Legacy authentication methods are among the top attack vectors for cloud-hosted
services. Created before multifactor-authentication existed, legacy protocols
don’t support additional factors beyond passwords and are therefore prime
targets for password spraying, dictionary, or brute force attacks. As an example
nearly 100% of all password spray attacks against Office 365 customers use
legacy protocols. Additionally, these older protocols frequently lack other
attack countermeasures, such as account lockouts or back-off timers. Services
running on Microsoft’s cloud that block legacy protocols have observed a 66%
reduction in successful account compromises.

For Azure and other Azure AD-based accounts, configure Conditional Access to
block legacy protocols.

Disabling legacy authentication can be difficult, as some users may not want to
move to new client software that supports modern authentication methods.
However, moving away from legacy authentication can be done gradually. Start by
using metrics and logging from your authentication provider to determine the how
many users still authenticate with old clients. Next, disable any down-level
protocols that aren’t in use, and set up conditional access for all users who
aren’t using legacy protocols. Finally, give plenty of notice and guidance to
users on how to upgrade before blocking legacy authentication for all users on
all services at a protocol level.
