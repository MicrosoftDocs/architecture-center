## DevOps and deployment automation

In an on premises environment, we do not typically have the luxury of being able to access APIs to turn on/off, or scale up/down workloads, in the same way as we do in the cloud.

As we have a rich set of APIs, SDKs and automation technology that we can call upon, utilizing DevOps and even more classical automation principles enables us to ensure that the workload is available at an appropriate level of scale as needed.

You may not have to leave the service running all of the time, incurring a consistent cost, consider whether it is actually a business requirement to leave the service online permanently 24x7, or could we save cost by shutting down the service or scaling it down outside normal business hours?

If so, could we repurpose some compute / data resources for other tasks that run out of business hours? See the [Compute Resource Consolidation](../patterns/compute-resource-consolidation.md) pattern and consider containers or elastic pools for more compute and data cost flexibility, more on this below.
