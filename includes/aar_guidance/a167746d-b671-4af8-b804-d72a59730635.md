## Align network segmentation with enterprise segmentation strategy

Align your network segmentation model with the enterprise segmentation model for
your organization (defined in Governance, Risk, and Compliance section).

This will reduce confusion and resulting challenges with different technical
teams (networking, identity, applications, etc.) each developing their own
segmentation and delegation models that donâ€™t align with each other. This leads
to a straightforward and unified security strategy, which helps reduce the
number of errors due to human error and inability to increase reliability
through automation.
