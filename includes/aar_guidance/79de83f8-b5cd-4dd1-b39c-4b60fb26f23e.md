ms.assessment_question: You use built-in roles where possible
---
## Use built-in roles

Use built-in roles for assigning permissions where possible.

Customization leads to complexity that increases confusion and makes automation
more complex, challenging, and fragile. These factors all negatively impact
security

We recommend that you evaluate the [built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles)
designed to cover most normal scenarios. [Custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles)
are a powerful and sometimes useful capability, but they should be reserved for
cases when built in roles wonâ€™t work.
