## Simulation testing

Simulation testing involves creating small, real-life situations. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the solutions in the recovery plan and highlight any issues that weren't adequately addressed.

As you perform simulation testing, follow best practices:

- Conduct simulations in a manner that doesn't disrupt actual business but feels like a real situation.
- Make sure that simulated scenarios are completely controllable. If the recovery plan seems to be failing, you can restore the situation back to normal without causing damage.
- Inform management about when and how the simulation exercises will be conducted. Your plan should detail the time frame and the resources affected during the simulation.
