ms.assessment_question: Third-party services have documented SLAs and support information

## Managing 3rd party services

If your application has dependencies on third-party services, identify how these services can fail and what effect failures will have on your application.

A third-party service might not include monitoring and diagnostics. Log calls to these services and correlate them with your application's health and diagnostic logging using a unique identifier. For more information on proven practices for monitoring and diagnostics, see [Monitoring and diagnostics guidance](../best-practices/monitoring.md).

See the [Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring) for a solution to track this with code samples.
