## Release process

Use VSTS release management for end-to-end traceability. Utilize VSTS history and auditing for a consolidated view of changes to code and infrastructure.

One of the challenges with automating deployment is the cut-over itself, taking software from the final stage of testing to live production. You usually need to do this quickly in order to minimize downtime. The blue-green deployment approach does this by ensuring you have two production environments, as identical as possible.

Use VSTS Release Management for continuous delivery of software at a faster pace and with lower risk.
