ms.assessment_question: Third-party services are monitored

## Monitoring third-party services

If your application has dependencies on third-party services, identify where and how these services can fail and what effect those failures will have on your application. Keep in mind the service-level agreement (SLA) for the third-party service and the effect it might have on your disaster recovery plan.

A third-party service might not provide monitoring and diagnostics capabilities, so it's important to log your invocations of them and to correlate them with your application's health and diagnostic logging using a unique identifier. For more information on proven practices for monitoring and diagnostics, see [Monitoring and diagnostics guidance](../best-practices/monitoring.md).
