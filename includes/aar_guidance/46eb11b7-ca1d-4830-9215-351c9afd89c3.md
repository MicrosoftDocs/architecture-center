## You have a strategy around identity in place that you are adhering to.

Manage accounts from one single location, regardless of where an account is created. Enable single sign-on.

Turn on conditional access because focusing on who can access a resource is not sufficient anymore. Enable password management and use appropriate security policies to prevent abuse.
