## Subscription offer type

Azure usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web Direct, and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customers based on specific subscription types as described [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/offer-details/). Some subscription types also include usage allowances or lower prices, which affect costs. For example, Azure [Dev/Test subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0148p/) types offers lower prices on Azure services such as specific VM sizes, PaaS web apps and VM images with pre-installed software. On the other hand, Visual Studio subscribers obtain as part of their benefits access to [Azure subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0063p/) with monthly allowances.
