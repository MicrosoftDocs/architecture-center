## Assign privileges for managing the environment

Grant roles with operational responsibilities in Azure the appropriate
permissions based on a clearly documented strategy built from the principle of
least privilege and your operational needs.

Providing clear guidance that follows a reference model will reduce risk because
by increasing it provides clarity for your technical teams implementing these
permissions. This clarity makes it easier to detect and correct human errors
like overpermissioning, reducing your overall risk.

Microsoft recommends starting from these Microsoft reference models and adapting to your organization.

### Core Services Reference Permissions
This segment hosts shared services
utilized across the organization. These shared services typically include
Active Directory Domain Services, DNS/DHCP, System Management Tools hosted
on Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) virtual machines.

**Security Visibility across all resources** – For security teams, grant
read-only access to security attributes for all technical environments. This
access level is needed to assess risk factors, identify potential
mitigations, and advise organizational stakeholders who accept the risk. See
[Security Team Visibility](#security-team-visibility) for more details.

**Policy management across some or all resources** – To monitor and enforce
compliance with external (or internal) regulations, standards, and security
policy, assign appropriate permission to those roles. The roles and
permissions you choose will depend on the organizational culture and
expectations of the policy program. See [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/governance/security-baseline/index).

**Central IT operations across all resources** – Grant permissions to the
central IT department (often the infrastructure team) to create, modify, and
delete resources like virtual machines and storage.

**Central networking group across network resources** – To ensure consistency
and avoid technical conflicts, assign network resource responsibilities to a
single central networking organization. These resources should include
virtual networks, subnets, Network Security Groups (NSG), and the virtual
machines hosting virtual network appliances. See [Centralize Network Management And Security](/azure/architecture/security/network-security-containment#centralize-network-management-and-security) for more details

**Resource Role Permissions** – For most core services, administrative
privileges required to manage them are granted via the application itself
(Active Directory, DNS/DHCP, System Management Tools, etc.), so no
additional Azure resource permissions are required. If your organizational
model requires these teams to manage their own VMs, storage, or other Azure
resources, you can assign these permissions to those roles.

**Service admin (Break Glass Account)** – Use the service admin role only for
emergencies (and initial setup if required). Do not use this role for daily
tasks. See [Emergency Access (‘Break Glass’ Accounts)](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#emergency-access-or-break-glass-accounts) for more details.

### Segment reference permissions

This segment permission design provides
consistency while allowing flexibility to accommodate the range of
organizational models from a single centralized IT group to mostly
independent IT and DevOps teams.

**Security visibility across all resources** – For security teams, grant
read-only access to security attributes for all technical environments. This
access level is needed to assess risk factors, identify potential
mitigations, and advise organizational stakeholders who accept the risk. See
[Security Team Visibility](#security-team-visibility).

**Policy management across some or all resources** – To monitor and enforce
compliance with external (or internal) regulations, standards, and security
policy assign appropriate permission to those roles. The roles and
permissions you choose will depend on the organizational culture and
expectations of the policy program. See [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/governance/security-baseline/index).

**IT Operations across all resources** – Grant permission to create, modify,
and delete resources. The purpose of the segment (and resulting permissions)
will depend on your organization structure.

-   Segments with resources managed by a centralized IT organization can grant
    the central IT department (often the infrastructure team) permission to
    modify these resources.

-   Segments managed by independent business units or functions (such as a Human
    Resources IT Team) can grant those teams permission to all resources in the
    segment.

-   Segments with autonomous DevOps teams don’t need to grant permissions across
    all resources because the resource role (below) grants permissions to
    application teams. For emergencies, use the service admin account
    (break-glass account).

**Central networking group across network resources** – To ensure consistency
and avoid technical conflicts, assign network resource responsibilities to a
single central networking organization. These resources should include
virtual networks, subnets, Network Security Groups (NSG), and the virtual
machines hosting virtual network appliances. See [Centralize Network Management And Security](/azure/architecture/security/network-security-containment#centralize-network-management-and-security).

**Resource Role Permissions** – Segments with autonomous DevOps teams will
manage the resources associated with each application. The actual roles and
their permissions depend on the application size and complexity, the
application team size and complexity, and the culture of the organization
and application team.

**Service Admin (Break Glass Account)** – Use the service admin role only for emergencies (and initial setup if required). Do not use this role for daily tasks. See [Emergency Access (‘Break Glass’ Accounts)](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#emergency-access-or-break-glass-accounts) for more details.



### Permission Guidance and Tips

-   To drive consistency and ensure application to future subscriptions,
    permissions should be assigned at management group for the segment rather
    than the individual subscriptions. See [Avoid Granular and Custom Permissions](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#avoid-granular-and-custom-permissions) for more details.

-   You should first review the built-in roles to see if one is applicable
    before creating a custom role to grant the appropriate permissions to VMs
    and other objects. See [Use Built in Roles](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#use-built-in-roles) for more details

-   **Security managers** group membership may be appropriate for smaller
    teams/organizations where security teams have extensive operational
    responsibilities.
