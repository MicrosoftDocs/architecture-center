ms.assessment_question: Deployed the application across multiple regions
---
## Operating in multiple regions


If your application is deployed to a single region, in the rare event the entire region becomes unavailable, your application will also be unavailable. This may be unacceptable under the terms of your application's SLA. If so, consider deploying your application and its services across multiple regions. A multi-region deployment can use an active-active pattern (distributing requests across multiple active instances) or an active-passive pattern (keeping a "warm" instance in reserve, in case the primary instance fails)
