## Evolve security beyond network controls

Ensure technical controls can effectively prevent, detect, and respond to
threats outside the networks you control.

As organizations shift to modern architectures, many services and components
required for applications will be accessed over the internet or on cloud
provider networks, often by mobile and other devices off the network.
Traditional network controls based on a *'trusted intranet'* approach will not
be able to effectively provide security assurances for these applications. This
shifting landscape is captured well by principles documented by the [Jericho
Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Forum) and ‘Zero Trust’ approaches.

Build a risk containment strategy based on a combination of network controls and
application, identity, and other control types.

-   Ensure that resource grouping and administrative privileges align to the
    segmentation model (see figure XXXX)

-   Ensure you are designing security controls that identify and allow expected
    traffic, access requests, and other application communications between
    segments. Monitor communications between segments to identify on any
    unexpected communications so you can investigate whether to set alerts or
    block traffic to mitigate risk of adversaries crossing segmentation
    boundaries.
