ms.assessment_question: You have clear objectives and metrics related to security
---
## Objective and metrics

The metrics you measure will have a significant effect on the behaviors and
outcomes of security operations. Focusing on the right measurements will help
drive continuous improvement in the right areas that meaningfully reduce risk.

To ensure that security operations are effectively containing attackers access,
the objectives should focus on

-   Reducing **time to acknowledge** an alert to ensure that detected
    adversaries are not ignored while defenders are spending time investigating
    false positives.

-   Reducing **time to remediate** a discovered adversary to reduce their
    opportunity time to conduct and attack and reach sensitive systems

-   **Prioritizing** security investments into systems that have high intrinsic
    value (likely targets / high business impact) and access to many systems or
    sensitive systems (administrator accounts and sensitive users)

-   Increase focus on **proactively hunting** for adversaries as your program
    matures and reactive incidents get under control. This is focused on
    reducing the time that a higher skilled adversary can operate in the
    environment (for example, skilled enough to evade reactive alerts).
