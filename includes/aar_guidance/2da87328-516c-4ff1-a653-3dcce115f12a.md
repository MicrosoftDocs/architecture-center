## Manual responses

Although automation is ideal, some strategies for disaster recovery require manual responses.

### Alerts

Monitor your application for warning signs that may require proactive intervention. For example, if Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB consistently throttles your application, you might need to increase your database capacity or optimize your queries. Even though the application might handle the throttling errors transparently, your telemetry should still raise an alert so that you can follow up.

For service limits and quota thresholds, we recommend configuring alerts on Azure resources metrics and diagnostics logs. When possible, set up alerts on metrics, which are lower latency than diagnostics logs.

Through [Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-checks-resource-types), Azure provides some built-in health status checks that can help you diagnose Azure service throttling issues.

### Failover

Configure a disaster recovery strategy for each Azure application and its Azure services. Acceptable deployment strategies to support disaster recovery may vary based on the SLAs required for all components of each application.  

Azure provides different features within many Azure services to allow for manual failover, such as [redis cache geo-replicas](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-geo-replication), or for automated failover, such as [SQL auto-failover groups](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auto-failover-group). For example:

- For an application that mainly uses virtual machines, you can use Azure Site Recovery for the web and logic tiers. For more information, see [Azure to Azure disaster recovery architecture](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-architecture). For SQL Server on VMs, use [SQL Server Always On availability groups](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-dr).
- For an application that uses App Service and Azure SQL Database, you can use a smaller tier App Service plan configured in the secondary region, which autoscales when a failover occurs. Use failover groups for the database tier.

In either scenario, an [Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) profile provides for the automated failover across regions. [Load balancers](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) or [application gateways](/azure/application-gateway/overview) should be set up in the secondary region to support faster availability on failover.

### Operational readiness testing

Perform an operational readiness test for failover to the secondary region and for failback to the primary region. Many Azure services support manual failover or test failover for disaster recovery drills. Alternatively, you can simulate an outage by shutting down or removing Azure services.
