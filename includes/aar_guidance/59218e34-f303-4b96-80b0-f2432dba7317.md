ms.assessment_question: Use async calls and waits to prevent locks
---
## Asynchronous Programming

Use the Asynchronous Programming pattern available in your programming language where it makes sense. Using asynchronous calls ensures that I/O is a non-blocking operation, which is especially important when making calls over the network. 

For operations that cannot be asynchronous, ensure the resources are as close as possible to minimise latency e.g. in the same region, or in the same Proximity Placement Group.
