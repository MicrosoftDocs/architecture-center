## Marketplace

The Azure Marketplace offers both the Azure team's first-party products and services, as well as, services from third-party vendors. Different billing structures apply to each of these categories. The billing structures can range from free, PAYG, one-time purchase fee, or a managed offering with support and licensing monthly costs.
