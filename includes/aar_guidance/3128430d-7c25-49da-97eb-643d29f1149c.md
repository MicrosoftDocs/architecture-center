## Transient failure handling

Track the number of transient exceptions and retries over time to uncover issues or failures in your application's retry logic. A trend of increasing exceptions over time may indicate that the service is having an issue and may fail. For more information, see [Retry service specific guidance](../best-practices/retry-service-specific.md).
