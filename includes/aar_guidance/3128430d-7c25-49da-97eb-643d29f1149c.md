ms.assessment_question: Retries for transient errors are impelmented and logged

## Transient failure handling

Track the number of transient exceptions and retries over time to uncover issues or failures in your application's retry logic. A trend of increasing exceptions over time may indicate that the service is having an issue and may fail. For more information, see [Retry service specific guidance](/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific).

Leverage the [Retry Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) paying particular attention to [issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry#issues-and-considerations). Avoid getting in to an infinite retry loop by implementing [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker). Review and incorporate additional best practices guidance for [Transient fault handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults). While calling systems that have [Throttling pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/throttling) implemented ensure that your retries are not counter productive.
