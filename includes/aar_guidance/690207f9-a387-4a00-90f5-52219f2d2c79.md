ms.assessment_question: You audit and enforce policy compliance
---
## Audit and enforce policy compliance

Ensure that the security team is auditing the environment to report on
compliance with the security policy of the organization. Security teams may also
enforce compliance with these policies.

Organizations of all sizes will have security compliance requirements. Industry,
government, and internal corporate security policies all need to be audited and
enforced. Policy monitoring is critical to check that initial configurations are
correct and that it continues to be compliant over time.

In Azure, you can take advantage of Azure Policy to create and manage policies
that enforce compliance. Like Azure Blueprints, Azure Policies are built on the
underlying Azure Resource Manager capabilities in the Azure platform (and
Azure Policy can also be assigned via Azure Blueprints).

For more information on how to do this in Azure, please review **Tutorial: Create and manage policies to enforce compliance**.
