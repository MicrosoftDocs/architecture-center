## Top-down approach through threat modeling

![](images/app-code2.png)

Perform threat modeling on your business-critical applications to discover and
mitigate potential risks to your organization.

Threat modeling identifies risks to the application itself as well as risks
that application may pose to your enterprise particularly when evaluating
individual applications in a larger system.

Threat modeling can be used at any stage of application development or
production, but it is uniquely effective for the design stages of new
functionality because no real-world data yet exists for that application.

Because threat modeling is a skill intensive exercise, we recommend taking
measures to minimize time investment while maximizing security value:

1.  **Prioritize by risk** - Apply threat modeling first to business-critical
    applications that would have an outsize impact on the business if
    compromised

2.  **Limit Scope -** Perform threat modeling in progressive stages of detail
    to quickly identify quick wins and actionable mitigations before spending a
    lot of manual effort:

    1.  **Start with simple questions** method (See [Simple questions method](#simple-questions-method)) documented below to quickly get insight into risks and whether
        basic protections are in place

    2.  **Progressively evaluate Application Design** – as resource and
        expertise are available, move to a more advanced analysis using the
        STRIDE method [Advanced threat modeling techniques](#top-down-approach-through-threat-modeling) or
        another similar one already used by your team. Start with the
        architecture level design and progressively increase detail as time and
        resources allow:

        1.  **System level design** – includes applications and how they
            interact with each other

        2.  **Application level** – includes components of the application and
            how they interact with each other

        3.  **Component level** – includes how the individual component is
            composed and how each element of it interacts with each other

3.  **Align with Development lifecycle –** Optimize your efforts by aligning
    threat modeling activities with your application development lifecycles.

    1.  **Waterfall** – ensure major projects should include threat modeling
        during the design process and during significant updates to the
        application.

    2.  **DevOps** –Trigger threat modeling activities at a frequency that adds
        security value without over-burdening the development teams. Good
        integration points are during the introduction of significant features
        or changes to the application and a regular recurring calendar schedule
        for example, every quarter for business-critical applications.

    3.  **Legacy applications –** These applications typically lack support,
        source code access, and/or expertise in the organization, so perform
        threat modeling on a best effort basis with what application
        knowledge/expertise you have available.

### Simple questions method 

>   This simple questioning method is designed to get security professionals and
>   developers started on threat modelling before moving on to a more advanced
>   method like STRIDE or OWASP’s method (see, [Top-down approach through threat modeling](#top-down-approach-through-threat-modeling)).

>   For each application or component, ask and answer these questions

-   Are you authenticating connections using Azure AD, TLS (with mutual
    authentication), or another modern security protocol approved by your
    security team? This protects against unauthorized access to the application
    and data

    -   Between users and the application (if applicable)

    -   Between different application components and services (if applicable)

-   Do you limit which accounts have access to write or modify data in the
    application to only those required to do so? This reduces risk of
    unauthorized data tampering/alteration

-   Is the application activity logged and fed into a Security Information and
    Event Management (SIEM) via Azure Monitor or a similar solution? This helps
    the security team detect attacks and quickly investigate them.

-   Is business-critical data protected with encryption that has been approved
    by the security team? This helps protect against unauthorized copying of
    data while at rest.

-   Is inbound and outbound network traffic encrypted using TLS? This helps
    protect against unauthorized copying of data while in transit.

-   Is the application protected against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    attacks using services like Azure DDoS protection, Akamai, or similar? This
    protects against attacks designed to overload the application so it can’t be
    used

-   Does the application store any sign in credentials or keys to access other
    applications, databases, or services? This helps identify whether an attack
    can use your application to attack other systems.

-   Do the application controls allow you to fulfill security and privacy
    requirements for the localities you operate in? (This helps protect user’s private data and avoid compliance fines)

>   **Important:** Security is a complex topic and the potential risks are
>   limited only by the imagination of smart motivated attackers. These
>   questions are designed to help identify readily discoverable gaps that are
>   easily exploited by attackers. As you develop comfort and competencies with
>   this method, you can look to grow your ability to threat model by
>   progressing to advanced threat modelling techniques.

### Advanced threat modeling techniques

>   A more comprehensive threat model can identify more potential risks, two
>   popular techniques are STRIDE and OWASP

-   **Microsoft** Security Development Lifecycle has documented a process of
    threat modeling in and released a free tool to assist with this process

    -   This method evaluates application components and
        connections/relationships against potential risks, which map to the
        STRIDE mnemonic:

        -   Spoofing

        -   Tampering

        -   Repudiation

        -   Information Disclosure

        -   Denial of Service

        -   Privilege Elevation

    -   This method can be applied to any level of the design from the high
        level architectural specific application components.

-   **OWASP –** The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has documented
    a threat modeling approach for applications, which refers to STRIDE and
    other methods
