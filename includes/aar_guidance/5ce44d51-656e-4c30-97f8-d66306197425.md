ms.assessment_question: You prioritize alert and log integration
---
## Prioritize alert and log integration

Ensure that you are integrating critical security alerts and logs into SIEMs
without introducing a high volume of low value data.

Introducing too much low value data can increase SIEM cost, increase noise and
false positives, and lower performance.

The data you collect should be focused on supporting one or more of these
operations activities:

-   **Alerts** (detections from existing tools or data required for generating
    custom alerts)

-   **Investigation** of an incident (for example, required for common queries)

-   Proactive **hunting** activities

Integrating more data can allow you to enrich alerts with additional context
that enable rapid response and remediation (filter false positives, and elevate
true positives, etc.), but collection is not detection. If you donâ€™t have a
reasonable expectation that the data will provide value (for example, high volume of firewall denies events), you may deprioritize integration of these events.
