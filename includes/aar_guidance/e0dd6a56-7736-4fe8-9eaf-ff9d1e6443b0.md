## Continous deployment / continous integration

Use feature toggles and canary releases. Utilize App Service deployment slots to safely deploy applications.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. The key details to note are that you need to run code integration multiple times a day, every day, and you need to run the automated verification of the integration. Whatâ€™s the motivation for this? Well, in the development process, the earlier we surface errors, the better. And one source of frequently occurring errors is the code integration step.

Employ VSTS continuous integration to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.

Use VSTS continuous delivery to deploy tested code automatically.
