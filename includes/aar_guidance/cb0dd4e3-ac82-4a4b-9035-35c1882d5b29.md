## Application lifespan and what should be automated

Does your service run seasonally or follow long-term patterns?

Some Azure services offer the concept of â€˜reserved instances', that can be utilized to yield further cost savings on predictable VM sizes that will be utilized for the solution's components.

If these are available, consider purchasing Seasonal/one-off or long term (RIs). Reserved instances are purchased in one-year or three-year terms, with payment required for the full term up front. After purchase, the reservation is matched up to running instances of the same SKU size or same-family SKU sizes and hours from your reservation will be decremented accordingly.

Note that while Reservation expects you to do similar planning that you'd perform before a hardware purchase, it is still an Operational Expense with all corresponding benefits. Consider purchasing reserved instances to fine tune cost savings on solutions that have been running in the cloud for a period to more confidently forecast the reserved instance sizes that will need to be purchased.
