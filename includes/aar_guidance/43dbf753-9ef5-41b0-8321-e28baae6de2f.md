ms.assessment_question: You have identified how long the workload can be down for, and how much data it's acceptable to lose in a disaster.

## Recovery metrics

Derive these values by conducting a risk assessment, and make sure you understand the cost and risk of downtime and data loss. These are nonfunctional requirements of a system and should be dictated by business requirements.

- **Recovery time objective (RTO)** is the maximum acceptable time an application is unavailable after an incident.
- **Recovery point objective (RPO)** is the maximum duration of data loss that's acceptable during a disaster.

If the MTTR value of *any* critical component in a highly available setup exceeds the system RTO, a failure in the system might cause an unacceptable business disruption. That is, you can't restore the system within the defined RTO.
