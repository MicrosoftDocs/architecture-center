## You have a system in place to manage identity.

Don't take this decision lightly, for the following reasons:                 It's the first decision for an organization that wants to move to the cloud.                 The authentication method is a critical component of an organization’s presence in the cloud. It controls access to all cloud data and resources.                 It's the foundation of all the other advanced security and user experience features in Azure AD.                 The authentication method is difficult to change after it's implemented.
