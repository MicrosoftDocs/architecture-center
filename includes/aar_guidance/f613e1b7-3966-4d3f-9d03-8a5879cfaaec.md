## Act on recommendations

Azure Advisor enables you to act on cost management recommendations from within the Azure Portal, such as resizing virtual machines. https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/tutorial-acm-opt-recommendations. Make sure that all stakeholders are in agreement regarding the implementation and timing of this change. Note that resizing a virtual machine does require the VM to be shut down and restarted, causing a period of time when it will be unavailable, so time this carefully for minimal business impact.
