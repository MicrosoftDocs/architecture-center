## Implemented alerting and monitoring

Review monitoring and diagnostics guidance. Review monitoring Azure applications and resources guidance.

Train multiple people on Azure Monitor. Send alerts and notifications to multiple recipients.

Automation around alerts is critical due to the highly collaborative nature of DevOps and the inherent speed needed for effective incident management. Earlier this year, a report from DevOps.com came out stating that 80% of IT teams are alerted to critical incidents via email. Email is an effective form of communication, but it shouldnâ€™t be the most common notification method for a critical issue.

Create, view, and manage alerts using Azure Monitor. Use Log Analytics Alerts based on conditions in Log Analytics data.

Use Azure Monitor, Azure Advisor, Azure Service Health, Activity Log, Azure Application Insights, Log Analytics, ExpressRoute monitor, Service Map, availability tests, and general monitoring Azure applications and resources.
