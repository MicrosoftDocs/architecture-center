ms.assessment_question: Have you tested your rollback procedure?

## Have you tested your rollback procedure? 

The most important step is to implement an architecture that supports the need to rollback. For instance, componentized, service based architectures lend themselves well to this. Persistent message queues and asynchronous services allow you to bring components down for rollback without impacting the main user base. Work towards something like the Blue-Green release pattern such that your application can stay available whilst you are working on one half of the system.
