## Don’t synchronize on-premises admin accounts to cloud identity providers

Don’t synchronize accounts with the highest privilege access to on premises
resources as you synchronize your enterprise identity systems with cloud
directories.

This mitigates the risk of an adversary pivoting to full control of on-premises
assets following a successful compromise of a cloud account. This helps contain
the scope of an incident from growing significantly.

For Azure, don’t synchronize accounts to Azure AD that have high privileges in
your existing Active Directory. This is blocked by default in the default Azure
AD Connect configuration, so you only need to confirm you haven’t customized
this configuration.

This is related to the [critical impact account dependencies](/azure/architecture/security/critical-impact-accounts#critical-impact-admin-dependencies--accountworkstation) guidance in
the administration section that mitigates the inverse risk of pivoting from on-premises to cloud assets.
