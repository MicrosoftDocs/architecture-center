## Bottom-up approach to reduce security bug volume and impact

![](images/app-code.png)

Reduce the count and potential severity of security bugs in your application by
implementing security practices and tools during the development lifecycle.

Security bugs can result in an application disclosing confidential data,
allowing criminals to alter data/records, or the data/application becoming
unavailable for use by customers and employees. Applications will always have
some logic errors that can result in security risk, so it is important to
discover, evaluate, and correct them to avoid damage to the organization’s
reputation, revenue, or margins. It is easier and cheaper to resolve these
earlier in the development lifecycle than it is to correct them after
application has completed testing, is in production use, or has been breached
frequently called 'shift left' or 'push left' principle.

Mitigating application risk is achieved by integrating security practices and
tools into the development lifecycle, often called a secure development
lifecycle (SDL or SDLC). Microsoft has published a number of recommendations in
a whitepaper entitled [Develop Secure Apps on
Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/abstract-develop-secure-apps)
based on Microsoft’s [Security Development
Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/SDL) to mitigate common risks with input
and output validation, perform fuzz testing, attack surface reviews, and more.
