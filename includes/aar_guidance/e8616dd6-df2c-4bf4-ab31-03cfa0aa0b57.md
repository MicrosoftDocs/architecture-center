## Adopt the DevOps approach

Organizations should shift from a ‘Waterfall’ development cycle to DevOps
lifecycle of continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) for
applications as fast as is practical. DevOps is the union of people, processes,
and tools that enable continuous delivery of value to end users. The
contraction of Dev and Ops refers to combining the development and operations
disciplines into multi-disciplinary teams that work together with shared and
efficient practices and tools.

The DevOps model increases the organization’s ability to rapidly address
security concerns without waiting for a longer planning and testing cycle of a
waterfall model.
