ms.assessment_question: You leverage native security capabilities built into cloud services.

## Use Native Security capabilities in application services

Use native security capabilities built into cloud services instead of adding
external security components (for data encryption, network traffic filtering,
threat detection, and other functions).

Native security controls are maintained and supported by the service provider,
eliminating or reducing effort required to integrate external security tooling
and update those integrations over time. Cloud services evolve rapidly, which
greatly increases the burden of maintaining an external tool and increases risk
of losing security visibility and protections from these tools if the tool
doesnâ€™t keep up with the cloud service.
