ms.assessment_question: You discover and remediate common risks

## Discover and remediate common risks

Identity well known risks for your Azure tenants, remediate those risks, and
track your progress using Secure Score.

Identifying and remediating common security hygiene risks significantly reduces
overall risk to your organization by increasing cost to attackers. When you
remove cheap and well-established attack vectors, attackers are forced to
acquire and use advanced or untested attack methods.

[Azure Secure Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-secure-score)
in Azure Security Center monitors the security posture of machines, networks,
storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security
issues (internet connected VMs, or missing security updates, missing endpoint
protection or encryption, deviations from baseline security configurations,
missing Web Application Firewall (WAF), and more). You should enable this
capability (no additional cost), review the findings, and follow the included
[recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations)
to plan and execute technical remediations starting with the highest priority
items.

As you address risks, track progress and prioritize ongoing investments in your
governance and risk reduction programs.
