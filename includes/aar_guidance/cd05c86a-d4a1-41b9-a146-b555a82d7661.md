## Identity strategy

Many consider identity to be the primary perimeter for security. This is a shift from the traditional focus on network security. Network perimeters keep getting more porous, and that perimeter defense canâ€™t be as effective as it was before the explosion of BYOD devices and cloud applications. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the Azure solution for identity and access management. Azure AD is a multitenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service from Microsoft. It combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection into a single solution.

Manage accounts from one single location, regardless of where an account is created. Enable single sign-on. Otherwise, it becomes an administrative problem not only for IT but also for users who have to remember multiple passwords. Turn on conditional access because focusing on who can access a resource is not sufficient anymore. Enable password management and use appropriate security policies to prevent abuse.
