ms.assessment_question: You have appropriate emergency access accounts configured
---
## Emergency access or ‘Break Glass’ accounts

Ensure you have a mechanism for obtaining administrative access in case of an
emergency

While rare, sometimes extreme circumstances arise where all normal means of
administrative access are unavailable.

We recommend following the instructions at [Managing emergency access administrative accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access)
and ensure that security operations monitor these accounts carefully.
