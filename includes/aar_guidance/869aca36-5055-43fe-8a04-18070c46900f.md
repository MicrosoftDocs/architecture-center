## Treat resources as a utility

The cloud is all about change. Your resources in the cloud are virtual, and unless built for durability, are to be considered ephemeral. Your provider may reboot or replace your resources for troubleshooting or updates. Mapping resources as 1 to 1 drop in replacement for on-prem resources is not recommended.
