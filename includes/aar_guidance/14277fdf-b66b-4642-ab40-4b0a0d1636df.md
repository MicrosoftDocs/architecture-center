## How frequently are you checking in code?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. The key details to note are that you need to run code integration multiple times a day, every day, and you need to run the automated verification of the integration. Whatâ€™s the motivation for this? Well, in the development process, the earlier we surface errors, the better. And one source of frequently occurring errors is the code integration step.
