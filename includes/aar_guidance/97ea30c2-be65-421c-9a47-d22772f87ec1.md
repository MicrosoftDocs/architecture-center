## Establish segmentation with management groups

Structure management groups into a simple design that guides the enterprise
segmentation model.

Management groups offer the ability to consistently and efficiently manage resources (including multiple subscriptions as needed). However, because of their flexibility, it's possible to create an overly complex design. Complexity creates confusion
and negatively impacts both operations and security (as illustrated by overly
complex Organizational Unit (OU) and Group Policy Object (GPO) designs for
Active Directory).

Microsoft recommends aligning the top level of management groups (MGs) into a
simple [enterprise segmentation strategy](/azure/architecture/security/governance#enterprise-segmentation-strategy) limited to 1 or 2 levels.
