## Data Compression

A well known optimization best practice for scaling web applications is to use a compression strategy to compress and bundle web pages or api responses. The idea here is to shrink the results returned from a page or api back to the browser or client app. This optimizes network traffic and accelerating the web application. .NET has built in framework support for this technique with GZip compression. An example of using response compression with ASP.NET Core here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/response-compression?view=aspnetcore-3.0>. The reason this can dramatically impact scale is the network optimization benefit means less socket processing for the web server reducing web server cpu utilization, shortening connections, and thus allowing the web server to handle more concurrent requests.
