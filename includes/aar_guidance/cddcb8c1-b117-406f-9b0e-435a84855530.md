## Role-based access control(RBAC)

Use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant access based on Azure Active Directory identities and groups.

Role-based: If you want to authorize based on users. A user can either be an administrator, creator, or reader. If you want to authorize an action based on a particular resource, consider resource based. For example, the app can check whether a user is the owner for of a resource.
