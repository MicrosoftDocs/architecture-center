## Resilience

Building cybersecurity resilience into your organization requires balancing
investments across the security lifecycle, diligently applying maintenance, vigilantly responding to anomalies and alerts to prevent security
assurance decay, and designing to defense in depth and least privilege.

Balancing your investments will help you both prevent cybersecurity attacks
and rapidly restore normal operations in the event of a successful attack.
By investing in both of these, you will reduce the risk your organization
faces. The functions of the [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) map well to these dual goals:

-   **Identify/Protect –** Understanding your posture, your attackers, and
    invest in establishing and improving controls to prevent attacks on data and
    systems over time. A defense in-depth approach can further mitigate risk
    including supplemental controls designed to handle the potential failure of
    primary control (for example, assuming network controls will fail and implementing
    endpoint and data security protections)

-   **Detect/Respond/Recovery –** Stay vigilant so that when attackers do get
    access to systems and data, you can rapidly detect them and restore normal
    operations and security assurances
