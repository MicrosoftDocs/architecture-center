ms.assessment_question: You manage connected tenants

## Manage connected tenants

Ensure your security organization is aware of all enrollments and associated
subscriptions connected to your existing environment (via ExpressRoute or
Site-Site VPN) and monitoring as part of the overall enterprise.

These azure resources are part of your enterprise environment and security
organizations require visibility into them. Security organizations need this
access to assess risk and to identify whether organizational policies and
applicable regulatory requirements are being followed.

Ensure all Azure environments that connect to your production
environment/network apply your organizationâ€™s policy and IT governance controls
for security. You can discover existing connected tenants using a
[tool](http://aka.ms/magicbutton) provided by Microsoft. Guidance on permissions
you may assign to security is in the [Assign privileges for managing the
environment](#assign-privileges-for-managing-the-environment) section.
