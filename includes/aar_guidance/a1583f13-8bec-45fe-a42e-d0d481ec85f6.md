## Data in transit

If data moving over a network is not encrypted, thereâ€™s a chance that it can be captured and stolen by unauthorized users. When you're dealing with database services, make sure that data is encrypted between the database client and server. Also make sure that data is encrypted between database servers that communicate with each other and with middle-tier applications.
