## Collection and storage

Raw instrumentation data can be held in various locations and formats, including:

- Application trace logs
- IIS logs
- Performance counters

These disparate sources are collected, consolidated, and placed in reliable data stores in Azure, such as Application Insights, Azure Monitor metrics, Service Health, storage accounts, and Azure Log Analytics.
