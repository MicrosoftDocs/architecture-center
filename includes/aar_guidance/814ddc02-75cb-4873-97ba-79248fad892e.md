## correlating calls across systems (end-to-end tracing)

You must think about security for all resources that take part in the workload. Azure Security Center provides integrated security monitoring and policy management across your Azure subscriptions. The events collected from the agents and from Azure are correlated in the security analytics engine to provide you tailored recommendations (hardening tasks), that you should follow to make sure your workloads are secure, and threat detection alerts. You should investigate such alerts as soon as possible to make sure malicious attacks aren't taking place on your workloads.
