ms.assessment_question: You authenticate via identity services where you can.

## Prefer Identity Authentication over Keys

Always authenticate with identity services rather than cryptographic keys when
available.

Managing keys securely with application code is difficult and regularly leads to
mistakes like accidentally publishing sensitive access keys to code repositories
like GitHub. Identity systems offer secure and usable experience for access
control with built-in sophisticated mechanisms for key rotation, monitoring for
anomalies, and more. Most organizations also have skilled teams dedicated to
managing identity systems and few (if any) people actively managing key security
systems.

For services that offer the Azure AD authentication like [Azure
Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-security-attributes),
[Azure App
Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-security-attributes),
[Azure
Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-security-attributes),
use it for authentication and authorization. To further simplify using
identities for developers, you can also take advantage of [managed
identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)
to assign identities to resources like VMs and App Services so that developers
donâ€™t have to manage identities within the application.
