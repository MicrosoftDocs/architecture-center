ms.assessment_question: You are testing your workload by injecting faults.

## Perform fault injection testing

For fault injection testing, check the resiliency of the system during failures, either by triggering actual failures or by simulating them. Here are some strategies to induce failures:

- Shut down virtual machine (VM) instances.
- Crash processes.
- Expire certificates.
- Change access keys.
- Shut down the DNS service on domain controllers.
- Limit available system resources, such as RAM or number of threads.
- Unmount disks.
- Redeploy a VM.

Your test plan should incorporate possible failure points identified during the design phase, in addition to common failure scenarios:

- Test your application in an environment as close to production as possible.
- Test failures in combination.
- Measure the recovery times, and be sure that your business requirements are met.
- Verify that failures don't cascade and are handled in an isolated way.

For more information about failure scenarios, see [Failure and disaster recovery for Azure applications](./disaster-recovery.md).
