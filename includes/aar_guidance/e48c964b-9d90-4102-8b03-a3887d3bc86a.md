## Enable enhanced network visibility

You should enable enhanced network visibility by integrating network logs into a
Security information and event management (SIEM) like Azure Sentinel or a third
partner solution such as Splunk, QRadar, or ArcSight ESM.

Integrating logs from your network devices, and even raw network traffic itself,
will provide you greater visibility over potential security threats flowing over
the wire. This log information can be integrated in advanced SIEM solutions or
other analytics platforms. The modern machine learning based analytics platforms support ingestion of extremely large amounts of information and can analyze
large datasets very quickly. In addition, these solutions can be tuned to
significantly reduce false positive alerts.

Examples of network logs that provide visibility include:

-   Security group logs â€“ [flow logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal)
    and diagnostic logs

-   [Web application firewall logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics)

-   [Virtual network taps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-tap-overview)
    and their equivalents

-   [Azure Network Watcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview)
