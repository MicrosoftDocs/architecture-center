## Resiliency strategies

This section describes some common resiliency strategies. Most of these strategies are not limited to a particular technology. The descriptions summarize the general idea behind each technique and include links to further reading.

- **Implement resiliency patterns** for remote operations, where appropriate. If your application depends on communication between remote services, follow [design patterns](/azure/architecture/patterns/category/resiliency) for dealing with transient failures.

- **Retry transient failures.** These can be caused by momentary loss of network connectivity, a dropped database connection, or a timeout when a service is busy. Often, a transient failure can be resolved by retrying the request.

  - For many Azure services, the client software development kit (SDK) implements automatic retries in a way that is transparent to the caller. See [Retry guidance for specific services](/azure/architecture/best-practices/retry-service-specific).
  - Or implement the [Retry pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) to help the application handle anticipated, temporary failures transparently when it tries to connect to a service or network resource.

- **Use a circuit breaker** to handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to fix. The [Circuit Breaker pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) can prevent an application from repeatedly trying an operation that is likely to fail. The circuit breaker wraps calls to a service and tracks the number of recent failures. If the failure count exceeds a threshold, the circuit breaker starts returning an error code without calling the service. This gives the service time to recover and helps avoid cascading failures.
- **Isolate critical resources.** Failures in one subsystem can sometimes cascade, resulting in failures in other parts of the application. This can happen if a failure prevents resources such as threads or sockets from being freed, leading to resource exhaustion. To avoid this, you can partition a system into isolated groups so that a failure in one partition does not bring down the entire system.

    Here are some examples of this technique, which is sometimes called the [Bulkhead pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead):

  - Partition a database (for example, by tenant), and assign a separate pool of web server instances for each partition.
  - Use separate thread pools to isolate calls to different services. This helps to prevent cascading failures if one of the services fails. For an example, see the Netflix [Hystrix library](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-hystrix-for-resiliency-engineering-13531c1ab362).
  - Use [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) to limit the resources available to a particular subsystem.

- **Apply [*compensating transactions*](/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction.md)**. A compensating transaction is a transaction that undoes the effects of another completed transaction. In a distributed system, it can be difficult to achieve strong transactional consistency. Compensating transactions help to achieve consistency by using a series of smaller, individual transactions that can be undone at each step. For example, to book a trip, a customer might reserve a car, a hotel room, and a flight. If one of these steps fails, the entire operation fails. Instead of trying to use a single distributed transaction for the entire operation, you can define a compensating transaction for each step.
- **Implement asynchronous operations, whenever possible.** Synchronous operations can monopolize resources and block other operations while the caller waits for the process to complete. Design each part of your application to allow for asynchronous operations, whenever possible. For more information on how to implement asynchronous programming in C\#, see [Asynchronous Programming](/dotnet/articles/csharp/async).
