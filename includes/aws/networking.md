| Area | AWS service | Azure service | Description |
| -----| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Cloud virtual networking | [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc) | [Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) | These services provide an isolated private environment in the cloud. You have control over your virtual networking environment, including the selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. In AWS, each subnet must reside in one availability zone. In Azure, subnets can span multiple availability zones. |
| NAT gateways | [AWS NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) | [Azure NAT Gateway](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview) |These services simplify outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. On a subnet, you can configure all outbound connectivity to use static public IP addresses that you specify. Outbound connectivity is possible without a load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. AWS NAT gateways can only be associated with a single public IP. Azure NAT gateways can have multiple public IPs. |
| Cross-premises connectivity | [Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) | [VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) |AWS Site-to-Site VPN and Azure VPN Gateway provide enhanced-security, reliable VPN connections with high availability and support for industry-standard protocols. The key differences are in their integration with other cloud services and in specific features like route-based and policy-based VPNs in Azure. AWS VPN provides a maximum of 5 Gbps throughput, whereas Azure provides up to 10 Gbps. |
| DNS management | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) | [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/dns/) | Azure DNS lets you manage your DNS records by using the same credentials and billing and support contract that you use for your other Azure services. Both services support [DNSSEC](/azure/dns/dnssec). |
| DNS-based routing | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) | [Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager) | These services host domain names, route users to internet applications, connect user requests to datacenters, manage traffic to apps, and improve app availability with automatic failover. |
| Dedicated network | [Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect) | [ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute) | These services establish a dedicated, private network connection from a location to the cloud provider (not over the internet). |
| Load balancing | [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) | [Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer)  | Azure Load Balancer load balances traffic at layer 4 (TCP or UDP). Standard Load Balancer also supports cross-subscription and global load balancing. |
| Application-level load balancing |  [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) | [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway) | Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer. It supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic. It also provides multi-site routing and security features. |
| Route tables | [Custom Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) | [User Defined Routes](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) | These tables provide custom or user-defined (static) routes to override default system routes, or to add more routes to a subnet's route table. |
| Private link | [PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink) | [Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link) | Azure Private Link provides private access to services that are hosted on the Azure platform. This keeps your data on the Microsoft network. |
| Private PaaS connectivity |  [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) | [Private Endpoint](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) | Private Endpoint provides secured, private connectivity to various Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources, over a backbone Microsoft private network. |
| Virtual network peering | [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) | [Virtual network peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) | Virtual network peering is a mechanism that connects two virtual networks in the same region through the Azure backbone network. After they're peered, the two virtual networks appear as one for all connectivity purposes. |
| Content delivery networks | [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront)| [Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor) | Azure Front Door is a modern cloud content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers high performance, scalability, and secure user experiences for your content and applications. |
| Network monitoring | [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) | [Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) | Azure Network Watcher allows you to monitor, diagnose, and analyze the traffic in Azure Virtual Network. |
| Virtual network peering | [AWS transit gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html) | [Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan/) | These services simplify and enhance network connectivity across multiple environments to support scalable and flexible network architectures. Virtual WAN integrates with Azure Firewall and Azure DDoS Protection to provide additional security features. AWS transit gateways rely on AWS security services like AWS Shield and AWS WAF. Virtual WAN is designed for global connectivity, so it's easier to connect branch offices and remote users worldwide. AWS transit gateways support 100 BGP prefixes per private connection. Virtual WAN private peering supports 1,000 BGP prefixes. |
| Cloud virtual networking | [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/) | [Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) | These services improve the availability and performance of your applications with global routing and traffic management. |
| Cross-premises connectivity | [AWS Direct Connect gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html) | [Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach) | These services extend your on-premises networks to the cloud with dedicated private connections that span multiple regions. |
| Application-level networking | [AWS App Mesh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html) | [Azure Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/) | These services provide application-level networking to manage microservices, including service discovery, load balancing, and traffic routing. |
| Service discovery | [AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/what-is-cloud-map.html) | [Azure Private DNS](/azure/dns/private-dns-overview) | These services provide service discovery for cloud resources. They enable you to register application resources and dynamically update their locations. |
