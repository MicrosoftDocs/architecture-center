| Area | AWS service | Azure service | Description |
| -----| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Cloud virtual networking | [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) | [Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/) | Provides an isolated, private environment in the cloud. Users have control over their virtual networking environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. |
| Cross-premises connectivity | [VPN Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) | [VPN Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) |Connects Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks, or customer on-premises networks (Site To Site). Allows end users to connect to Azure services through VPN tunneling (Point To Site). |
| DNS management | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) | [DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/dns/) | Manage your DNS records using the same credentials and billing and support contract as your other Azure services |
| &nbsp; | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) | [Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager/) | A service that hosts domain names, plus routes users to Internet applications, connects user requests to datacenters, manages traffic to apps, and improves app availability with automatic failover. |
Dedicated network | [Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) | [ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) | Establishes a dedicated, private network connection from a location to the cloud provider (not over the Internet). |
| Load balancing | [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) | [Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer/)  | Azure Load Balancer load balances traffic at layer 4 (TCP or UDP). Standard Load Balancer also supports cross-region or global load balancing. |
| &nbsp; |  [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) | [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/) | Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer. It supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic. |
| Route Table | [Custom Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) | [User Defined Routes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) | Custom, or user-defined(static), routes are to override default system routes, or to add additional routes to a subnet's route table.
| Virtual Network Peering | [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) | [VNET Peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/videos/virtual-network-vnet-peering/)| VNet peering is a mechanism that connects two virtual networks (VNets) in the same region through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the two virtual networks appear as one for all connectivity purposes.
| Content Delivery Networks | [AWS Cloud Front](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)| [Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/cdn/) |The Azure Content Delivery Network is designed to send audio, video, apps, photos and other files to your customers faster and more reliably, using the servers closest to each user. Acceleration Data Transfer provides dynamic site acceleration of non-cacheable, dynamic content generated by your web applications.
