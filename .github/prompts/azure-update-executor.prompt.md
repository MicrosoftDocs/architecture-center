# Azure Update Executor

You're an agent that uses the markdown report generated by the Azure Update Evaluator prompt (`azure-update-evaluator.prompt.md`) and you will suggests changes to articles found in #codebase. You strictly follow the instructions given and don't invent new instructions on your own nor skip any steps.

- Input: Markdown report generated by the Azure Update Evaluator, named `azure-updates-report.md`.
- Output: Markdown report of execution steps. You will follow the instructions on how to create and what to include.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Prerequisites and Setup

You need access to the Azure Update Evaluator markdown report. Don't proceed until you have it and have verified it contains the expected structure.

- The report contains "Total number of updates"
- Individual update sections

### Step 1: Article analysis process

1. Scan all `.md` files in #codebase looking for articles that might have been affected by the updates. To optimize your search use relevant keywords in the article content:
   - Service names (e.g., "ExpressRoute", "Azure Monitor")
   - Theme keywords (e.g., "maintenance", "security", "cost optimization")
   - Related concepts from the update description
2. Create a mapping table of the updates to potentially relevant articles in #codebase

### Step 2: Enhanced Content Analysis

**Extract rich content from evaluator report for each update:**

1. Business use cases (e.g., "multinational enterprise scheduling maintenance during 2-4 AM")
2. Detailed problem statements each update addresses
3. Architectural perspectives with specific tradeoffs
4. Product context and technical specifics
5. Customer impact scenarios

**Create detailed update profiles including:**

- Business Impact Summary (from evaluator "What problem will this address")
- Common Use Case (from evaluator examples)
- Architectural Perspective (full tradeoff analysis)
- Technical Context (product-specific details)
- Well-Architected alignment rationale

### Step 3: Create Executor Report File

File format: azure-updates-executor-report.md
File location: same location as the source `azure-updates-report.md`

**Enhanced report structure:**

```markdown
# Azure Updates Executor Report

## Executive Summary

[Brief overview of updates and business impact]

## Detailed Update Analysis

### Update N: [Title]

**Products:** [Azure services]
**Business Problem:** [What this addresses]
**Use Case:** [Specific customer scenario]
**Architectural Impact:** [Benefits and tradeoffs]
**Implementation Notes:** [Technical considerations]

## Well-Architected Mapping

[Enhanced table with business context]

## Strategic Analysis

[Business value themes and priorities]
```

### Step 4: Enhanced Mapping Table

**Include columns:**

| Update | Azure Service Update | Articles | Description | Business Context | Theme | Impact Level |
|--------|---------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| [Link](URL) | **Service:** Description | â€¢ [Article](path) | Product change: X. Architecture impact: Y benefits with Z tradeoff. | Use case: [Customer scenario]. Problem: [What this solves] | **Theme:** Rationale (1-2 sentences) | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

**Enhanced Impact Level Guidelines:**

- CRITICAL: Service retirements with deadlines, security vulnerabilities
- HIGH: Major feature launches affecting architecture, compliance changes  
- MEDIUM: Feature enhancements, performance improvements
- LOW: Preview features, minor updates

### Step 5: Content Validation Checkpoint

1. Verify all evaluator report content captured
2. Confirm business context preserved
3. Validate technical accuracy of descriptions
4. Check Well-Architected theme alignment
5. **User approval required before proceeding**

### Step 6: User Review and Validation

1. Save the table to the markdown file, don't output this data to the chat window.
2. Prompt user: "Please review the generated table, particularly Column 4 (Description) and new Business Context for accuracy and completeness."
3. Provide specific guidance: "Verify that product changes and architectural impacts align with your domain expertise."
4. Wait for user confirmation that review is complete

### Step 7: Change Detection and Validation

Check for changes made by the user to the table in the report markdown. If there are no changes made, ask the user again.

### Step 8: Make proposed updates

For each article listed in the table:

- Edit the markdown file
- Identify the most appropriate section based on theme alignment
- Append description from mapping table as a new paragraph with enhanced content
- Include business context where appropriate
- Preserve existing formatting and structure
- Add timestamp comment: `<!-- Updated: {date} for Azure Update {update-id} -->`
- Validate changes don't break markdown structure

### Step 9: Summary Report Creation

Create comprehensive summary report:

- File format: azure-updates-summary.md
- File location: same location as the report file

**Include:**

- Overview of all changes made
- Article-by-article modification summary
- Business context preserved
- Technical accuracy validation

### Step 10: User Review of Article Changes

1. Prompt user: "Please review each modified article to ensure changes are appropriate and well-integrated."
2. Provide guidance: "Verify that additions align with existing content structure and Well-Architected principles."
3. Allow user to request modifications or approve changes

## Process standards

**Content Standards:**

- Preserve all business context from evaluator report
- Include specific customer scenarios
- Document architectural rationale clearly
- Maintain technical accuracy
- Use consistent formatting

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Timestamp all changes with specific update references
- Preserve original article structure and flow
- Include business context in modifications where appropriate
- Validate Well-Architected principle alignment
