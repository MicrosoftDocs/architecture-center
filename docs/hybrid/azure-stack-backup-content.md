Backup and restore are essential components of any comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery strategy. Designing and implementing a consistent and reliable backup approach in a hybrid environment is challenging, but can be considerably simplified through integration with services provided by Microsoft Azure. This applies not only to the workloads running on traditional on-premises infrastructure, but also to those hosted by third-party public and private cloud providers. However, benefits of integration with Azure cloud services are particularly evident when the hybrid environments incorporate Azure Stack portfolio offerings, including the Azure Stack Hub.

While one of the primary strengths of Azure Stack Hub is its support for the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, it also helps customers to modernize their existing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) workloads. Such workloads might include file shares, Microsoft SQL Server databases, Microsoft SharePoint farms, and Microsoft Exchange Server clusters. Migrating them to VMs running on hyperconverged, highly-resilient clusters, with administrative and programming models consistent with Microsoft Azure, results in minimized management and maintenance overhead.

For implementing backup of files and applications running on Azure Hub Stack VMs, Microsoft recommends a hybrid approach that relies on a combination of cloud and on-premises components to deliver a scalable, performant, resilient, secure, straightforward to manage, and cost-efficient backup solution. The central component of this solution is Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) v3, which is part of the Azure Backup offering. MABS relies on Azure Stack Hub infrastructure for compute, network, and short-term storage resources, while it leverages Azure-based storage to serve as the long-term backup store. This minimizes or eliminates the need to maintain physical backup media such as tapes.

>[!Note]
>MABS is based on Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) and provides similar functionality with just a few differences. However, DPM is not supported for use with Azure Stack Hub.

## Architecture of the proposed solution

Cloud components include the following services:

- An Azure subscription that hosts all cloud resources included in this solution.
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant associated with the Azure subscription, which provides authentication of Azure AD security principals to authorize access to Azure resources.
- An Azure Recovery Services vault in the Azure region closest to an on-premises datacenter that will host the Azure Stack Hub deployment.

Depending on the criteria presented in this document, cloud components could also include the following services:

- An Azure ExpressRoute circuit between the on-premises datacenter and the Azure region hosting the Azure Recovery Services vault, configured with Microsoft peering to accommodate larger backup sizes.
- The Azure Import/Export service for enabling MABS offline backups to Azure.

  >[!Note]
  >As of 08/20, MABS offline backup to Azure by using Azure Data Box is in preview.

Depending on the use of the Azure Import/Export service for MABS offline backup to Azure, the solution might also have an Azure Storage account in the same Azure region as the Recovery Services vault.

The on-premises components include the following services:

- An Azure Stack Hub–integrated system in the connected deployment model, running the current update (2002 as of August 2020), and located within the customer's on-premises datacenter.
- A Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 VM hosted by the Azure Stack Hub–integrated system and running MABS v3 Update Release (UR) 1.
- Azure Stack Hub VMs with the MABS protection agent, which manages backups to and restores from the MABS Azure Stack Hub VM. The MABS protection agent tracks changes to protected workloads, and transfers the changes to the MABS data store. The protection agent also identifies data on its local computer that can be protected, and plays a role in the recovery process.
- A Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent installed on the server running MABS, providing integration between MABS and Azure Recovery Services vault.

   >[!Note]
  >MARS agent is also referred to as an *Azure Backup agent*.

## Core functionality

The proposed solution supports the following functionality on Azure Stack Hub VMs running Windows Server 2019, 2016, 2012 R2, 2012, 2008 R2 SP1 (64-bit with Windows Management Framework 4.0), 2008 SP2 (64-bit with Windows Management Framework 4.0), and Windows 10 (64-bit):

- Backup and restore of New Technology File System (NTFS) and Resilient File System (ReFS) volumes, shares, folders, files, and system state.
- Backup and restore of SQL Server 2019, 2017, 2016 (with required service packs [SPs]), and 2014 (with required SPs) instances and their databases.
- Backup and restore of Exchange Server 2019 and Exchange Server 2016 servers and databases, including standalone servers and databases in a database availability group (DAG).
- Restore of individual mailboxes and mailbox databases in a DAG.
- Backup and restore of SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint 2016 (with the latest SPs) farms and front-end web server content.
- Restore of SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint 2016 databases, web applications, files, list items, and search components.

   >[!Note]
  >To deploy Windows 10 client operating systems on Azure Stack Hub, you must have Windows per-user licensing or have purchased it through a Qualified Multitenant Hoster (QMTH).

MABS implements the disk-to-disk-to-cloud (D2D2C) backup scheme, with the primary backup stored locally on the server hosting the MABS installation. Local backups are subsequently copied to an Azure Site Recovery vault. The local disk functions as short-term storage, while the vault provides long-term storage.

  >[!Note]
  >Unlike DPM, MABS doesn't support tape backups.

At a high level, the backup process consists of the following four stages:

1. You install the MABS protection agent on a computer you want to protect, and add it to a protection group.
1. You set up protection for the computer or its app, including backup to MABS local disks for short-term storage and to Azure for long-term storage. As part of the setup, you specify the backup schedule for both types of backups.
1. The protected workload backs up to the local MABS disks according to the schedule you specified.
1. The local backup stored on MABS disks is backed up to the Azure Recovery Services vault by the MARS agent running on the MABS server.

## Prerequisites

Implementing the recommended solution is contingent on meeting the following prerequisites:

- Access to an Azure subscription, with permissions sufficient to provision an Azure Recovery Services vault in the Azure region closest to an on-premises datacenter hosting the Azure Stack Hub deployment.
- An Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain accessible from an Azure Stack Hub VM that will host a MABS instance.
- An Azure Stack Hub-hosted VM that will run a MABS instance, satisfying the prerequisites listed in [Install Azure Backup Server on Azure Stack][azure-backup-azure-stack] and with outbound connectivity to URLs listed in [DPM/MABS networking support][azure-backup-dpmmabs-support].

  >[!Note]
  >Additional disk space and performance considerations for MABS are described in more detail later in this document.

  >[!Note]
  >To validate whether the VM hosting MABS has connectivity to the Azure Backup service, you can use the **Get-DPMCloudConnection** cmdlet (included in the Azure Backup Server PowerShell module).

  >[!Note]
  >MABS also requires a local instance of SQL Server. For details regarding SQL Server requirements, refer to [Install and upgrade Azure Backup Server][azure-backup-server].

## Availability considerations

Azure Stack Hub helps increase workload availability through resiliency inherent to its infrastructure. You can further enhance the degree of this availability by designing and implementing solutions with the purpose of extending the scope of workload protection. This is the added value that MABS provides. In the context of MABS running on Azure Stack Hub, there are two aspects of availability that need to be explored in more detail:

- Availability of MABS and its data stores
- Availability of the point-in-time restore capability of MABS-protected workloads

You need to consider both of these when developing a backup strategy driven by recovery point objectives (RPOs) and recovery time objectives (RTOs). RTO and RPO represent continuity requirements stipulated by individual business functions within an organization. RPO designates a time period representing maximum acceptable data loss following an incident that affected availability of that data. RTO designates the maximum acceptable duration of time it can take to reinstate business functions following an incident that affected availability of these functions.

>[!Note]
>In general, to address the RTO requirements for Azure Stack Hub workloads, you should account for recovery of the Azure Stack infrastructure, user VMs, applications, and user data. In the context of this reference architecture document, we are interested only in the last two of these components - applications and user data - although we also present considerations regarding availability of the Modern Backup Storage (MBS) functionality.

MABS and its data stores availability is contingent on the availability of the VM hosting the MABS installation and its local and cloud-based storage. Azure Stack Hub VMs are highly available by design. In case of a MABS failure, you have the ability to restore Azure Backup–protected items from any other Azure Stack Hub VM hosting MABS. Note, however, that for a server hosting MABS to recover backups performed by using MABS running on another server, both servers must be registered with the same Azure Site Recovery vault.

>[!Note]
>In general, you could deploy another instance of MABS and configure it to back up the primary MABS deployment, similar to the primary-to-secondary protection, chaining, and cyclic protection configurations available when using DPM. However, this approach is not supported with MABS and it would not yield meaningful availability advantages in the scenario described in this reference architecture document.

The point-in-time restore capability of MABS-protected workloads is dependent to a large extent on the type of data, its backups, and its protection policies. To understand these dependencies, it's necessary to explore these concepts in more detail.

### Data types

From the perspective of MABS, there are two data types to consider:

- *File data* is data that typically resides on file servers (such as Microsoft Office files, text files, or media files), and which needs to be protected as flat files.
- *Application data* is data that exists on application servers (such as Exchange storage groups, SQL Server databases, or SharePoint farms) and which requires MABS to be aware of the corresponding application requirements.

>[!Note]
>As an alternative to file data backup with MABS, it is possible to install the MABS agent directly on Azure Stack Hub VMs and back up their local file system directly to an Azure Recovery Services vault. However, unlike MABS, this approach does not provide centralized management and always relies on cloud-based storage for backups and restores.

### Backup types

Whether you're protecting file data or application data, protection begins with creating a replica of the data source in the local storage of a MABS instance. The replica is synchronized or updated at regular intervals according to the settings that you configure. The method that MABS uses to synchronize the replica depends on the type of data being protected. If a replica is identified as being inconsistent, MABS performs a consistency check, which is a block-by-block verification of the replica against the data source.

For a file volume or share on a server, after the initial full backup, the MABS protection agent uses a volume filter and change journal to determine which files have changed. It then performs a checksum procedure for these files to synchronize only the changed blocks. During synchronization, these changes are transferred to MABS and then applied to the replica, thereby synchronizing the replica with the data source.

If a replica becomes inconsistent with its data source, MABS generates an alert that specifies which computer and which data sources are affected. To resolve the issue, you can repair the replica by initiating a synchronization with consistency check on the replica. During a consistency check, MABS performs a block-by-block verification and repairs the replica to return it to consistency with the data source. You can schedule a daily consistency check for protection groups or initiate a consistency check manually.

At regular intervals that you can configure, MABS creates a recovery point for the protected data source. A *recovery point* is a version of the data which can be recovered.

For application data, after the replica is created by MABS, changes to volume blocks that belong to application files are tracked by the volume filter. How changes are transferred to the MABS server depends on the application and the type of synchronization. The operation that is labeled *synchronization* in MABS Administrator Console is analogous to an incremental backup, and it creates a transactionally consistent, accurate reflection of the application data when combined with the replica.

During the type of synchronization that is labeled *express full backup* in MABS Administrator Console, a full Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) snapshot is created, but only changed blocks are transferred to the MABS server.

Each express full backup creates a recovery point for application data. If the application supports incremental backups, each synchronization also creates a recovery point. The synchronization process is application-dependent:

- For Exchange data, synchronization transfers an incremental VSS snapshot using the Exchange VSS writer. Recovery points are created for each synchronization and for each express full backup.
- SQL Server databases that are log-shipped, that are in read-only mode, or that use the simple recovery model, don't support incremental backup. Recovery points are created for each express full backup only. For all other SQL Server databases, synchronization transfers a transaction log backup, with recovery points created for each incremental synchronization and express full backup. The transaction log is a serial record of all the transactions that have been performed against the database since the transaction log was last backed up.
- SharePoint servers don't support incremental backup. Recovery points are created for each express full backup only.

Incremental synchronizations require less time than performing an express full backup. However, the time required to recover data increases as the number of synchronizations increases. This is because MABS must restore the last full backup and then restore and apply all the incremental synchronizations up to the point in time selected for recovery.

To enable faster recovery time, MABS regularly performs an express full backup, which updates the replica to include the changed blocks. During the express full backup, MABS takes a snapshot of the replica before updating the replica with the changed blocks. To enable more frequent RPOs and reduce the data loss window, MABS also performs incremental synchronizations in the time between two express full backups.

As with file data protection, if a replica becomes inconsistent with its data source, MABS generates an alert that specifies which server and which data sources are affected. To resolve the inconsistency, you can repair the replica by initiating a synchronization with consistency check on the replica. During a consistency check, MABS performs a block-by-block verification of the replica and repairs it to bring it back into consistency with the data sources. You can schedule a daily consistency check for protection groups or initiate a consistency check manually.

### Protection policies

A computer or its workload becomes protected when you install the MABS protection agent software on the computer and add its data to a protection group. Protection groups are used to configure and manage protection of data sources on computers. A *protection group* is a collection of data sources that share the same protection configuration. The *protection configuration* is the collection of settings that are common to a protection group, such as the protection group name, protection policy, storage allocations, and replica creation method.

MABS stores a separate replica of each protection group member in the storage pool. A protection group member can contain such data sources as:

- A volume, share, or folder on a file server or server cluster.
- A storage group of an Exchange server or server cluster.
- A database of an instance of SQL Server or server cluster.

You configure a protection policy for each protection group based on the recovery goals that you set up for that protection group. *Recovery goals* represent data protection requirements corresponding to your organization's RTOs and RPOs. Within MABS, they are defined based on a combination of the following parameters:

- Short-term retention range. This determines how long you want to retain backed up data on the local MABS storage.
- Synchronization and recovery point frequencies. This corresponds directly to data loss tolerance, which in turn reflects your organization's RPOs. It also determines how often MABS should synchronize its local replicas with protected data sources by collecting their data changes. You can set the synchronization frequency to any interval between 15 minutes and 24 hours. You can also select to synchronize just before a recovery point is created rather than on a specified time schedule.
- Short-term recovery point schedule. This establishes how many recovery points should be created in the local storage for the protection group. For file protection, you select the days and times for which you want recovery points created. For data protection of applications that support incremental backups, the synchronization frequency determines the recovery point schedule.
- Express full backup schedule. For data protection of applications that don't support incremental backups and do support express full backups, this determines the recovery point schedule.
- Online backup schedule. This determines frequency of creating a copy of local backups in the Azure Recovery Services vault that's associated with the local MABS instance. You can schedule it on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, with maximum allowed frequency of two backups per day. MABS automatically creates a recovery point for online backups using the most recent local replica, without transferring new data from the protected data source.

  >[!Note]
  >A Recovery Services vault supports up to 9,999 recovery points.

- Online retention policy. This specifies the time period during which daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly backups will be retained in the Azure Site Recovery vault associated with the local MABS instance.

  >[!Note]
  >To protect the latest content of the data source online, create a new recovery point on the local disk before creating an online recovery point.

  >[!Note]
  >By default, Azure Recovery Services vault is *geo-redundant*, meaning that any backup copied to its storage is automatically replicated to an Azure region that is part of a pre-defined region pair. You have the option to change the replication settings to locally redundant if that's sufficient for your resiliency needs and if you need to minimize the storage costs. However, you should consider keeping the default setting. In addition, keep in mind that this option cannot be changed if the vault contains any protected items.

  >[!Note]
  >For the listing of Azure region pairs, refer to [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions][azure-paired-regions].

## Scalability and performance considerations

When planning to deploy MABS on Azure Stack Hub, you need to consider the amount of processing, storage, and network resources allocated to the VM (or VMs) hosting the deployment. Microsoft recommends allocating 2.33 gigahertz (GHz) quad-core CPU to account for MABS processing needs, with about 10 GB disk space to accommodate the installation binaries. Additional storage requirements can be divided into the following categories:

- Disk space for backups. The general recommendation for backup disk space is to allocate a storage pool disk space that's equivalent to about 1.5 times the size of all data to be backed up. After the disks are attached to the VM, MABS manages volume and disk space management. The number of disks you can attach to a VM depends on its size.

  >[!Note]
  >You should not store backups locally for more than five days. Backups older than five days should be offloaded to the Azure Site Recovery vault.

- Disk space for MARS agent cache location. Consider using drive **C** on the VM hosting the MABS installation.
- Disk space for local staging area during restores. Consider using the temporary drive **D** on the VM hosting the MABS installation.

To provision storage for the VM hosting the MABS installation, use managed disks with Premium performance tier. The expected performance characteristics are 2,300 I/O operations per second (IOPS) and 145 megabyte (MB)/second per disk. (Note that unlike Azure, there are no performance guarantees for Azure Stack Hub.)

To obtain a more accurate estimate of storage required to accommodate Azure Stack Hub–based workload backups, consider using the Azure Stack VM Size Calculator for MABS, which is available from [Microsoft Downloads][azure-stack-vm-size-calculator]. The calculator is implemented as a Microsoft Excel workbook with macros that derive optimum Azure Stack Hub sizing information based on a number of parameters you provide. These parameters include:

- Source details containing a list of VMs to be protected, including for each:
  - The size of protected data
  - The workload type (Windows Server, SharePoint, or SQL Server)
- Data retention range, in days

Each workload type is by default associated with a predefined daily rate of changes (or *churn*). You have the option to adjust these values if they don't reflect the actual utilization patterns in your environment.

The Azure Stack VM Size Calculator for MABS will use the information you specified to provide:

- An estimated size of the Azure Stack Hub VM to host the installation of MABS.
- An estimated amount of MABS disk space needed to host backed up data.
- A total number of disks at 1 terabyte (TB) each.
- IOPS available for MABS usage.
- An estimated time to complete the initial backup (based on the total size of protected data and the IOPS available for MABS usage).
- An estimated time to complete daily backups (based on the total size of daily churn and the IOPS available for MABS usage).

>[!Note]
>Azure Stack VM Size Calculator for MABS was released in April 2018, which means that it doesn't take into account optimizations incorporated into MABS v3 (including those included in UR1). However, it does include enhancements specific to MBS, which was introduced in MABS v2 released in June 2017.

If you create a protection group by using the MABS graphical interface, whenever you add a data source to a protection group, MABS will also automatically calculate local disk space allocation based on the short-term recovery goals you specify. At that point, you have the option to decide how much space to allocate in the storage pool to replicas and recovery points for each data source that you have selected for membership in the group. In addition, you also need to ensure that there is sufficient space on local disks of protected servers for the change journal. MABS provides default space allocations for the members of the protection group. For details regarding the default space allocations for different MABS components, refer to [Deploy protection groups documentation][system-center-protection-groups].

Consider using the default space allocations unless you are certain that they don't meet your needs. Overriding the default allocations can result in allocation of too little or too much space. Allocation of too little space for the recovery points can prevent MABS from storing enough recovery points to meet your retention range objectives. Allocation of too much space wastes disk capacity. After creating a protection group, if you allocated too little space for a data source, you can increase the allocations for the replica and recovery point volumes for each data source. If you allocated too much space for the protection group, you can remove the data source from the protection group and delete the replica. Then add the data source to the protection group with smaller allocations.

If you need to adjust the estimated sizing of the Azure Stack Hub VM hosting MABS post-deployment to accommodate changes in processing or storage requirements, you have three basic options to choose from:

- Implement vertical scaling. This involves modifying the amount and type of processor, memory, and disk resources of the Azure Stack Hub VMs hosting MABS.
- Implement horizontal scaling. This involves provisioning or deprovisioning Azure Stack Hub VMs with MABS installed to match processing demands of protected workloads.
- Modify protection policies. This involves changing parameters of protection policies, including retention range, recovery point schedule, and express full backup schedule.

>[!Note]
>It is important to keep in mind that MABS is subject to limits in regard to the number of recovery points, express full backups, and incremental backups. For details regarding these limits, refer to [Recovery process][system-center-recovery-process].

If you opt to automatically grow volumes, then MABS accounts for the increased backup volume as the production data grows. Otherwise, MABS limits the backup storage to the size of data sources in the protection group.

From the networking standpoint, there are two main options to adjust available bandwidth:

- Increase VM size. In the case of Azure Stack Hub VMs, their size determines maximum network bandwidth. However, it's important to note that there are no bandwidth guarantees; instead, VMs are allowed to utilize the amount of available bandwidth up to the limit determined by their size.
- Increasing throughput of uplink switches. Azure Stack Hub systems support a range of hardware switches that offer several choices of uplink speeds. Each Azure Stack Hub cluster node has two uplinks to the top-of-rack switches for fault tolerance. The system allocates half of the uplink capacity for critical infrastructure, and the remainder is shared capacity for Azure Stack services and all user traffic. Systems deployed with faster speeds have more bandwidth available for backup traffic.

While in general it's possible to segregate network traffic by attaching a second network adapter to a server, in the case of Azure Stack Hub VMs, all VM traffic to the internet shares the same uplink. A second virtual network adapter will not segregate traffic at the physical transport level.

To accommodate larger backup sizes, you could consider leveraging Azure ExpressRoute with Microsoft peering for connections between Azure Stack Hub virtual networks and Azure Recovery Services vault. Azure ExpressRoute extends on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection supplied by a connectivity provider. You can purchase ExpressRoute circuits for a wide range of bandwidths, from 50 megabits per second (Mbps) to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).

>[!Note]
>For details regarding implementing Azure ExpressRoute in Azure Stack Hub scenarios, refer to [Connect Azure Stack Hub to Azure using Azure ExpressRoute][azure-stack-hub-expressroute].

>[!Note]
>MABS v3 leverages enhancements built into MBS, and optimizes network and storage usage by transferring only changed data during consistency checks.

## Manageability considerations

From the manageability standpoint, one of the primary considerations affecting your backup and restore strategy is the configuration of protection groups and criteria you use to decide which protected workloads should belong to the same protected groups. As described earlier in this document, a *protection group* is a collection of data sources such as volumes, shares, or application data stores, which have common backup and restore settings. When defining a protection group, you need to specify:

- Data sources, such as servers and workloads you want to protect.
- Back-up storage, including short-term and long-term protection settings.
- Recovery points, which are points in time from which backed up data can be recovered.
- Allocated disk space, which is the amount of disk space allocated for backups from the storage pool.
- Initial replication, which is the method of an initial backup of data sources, which can involve its transfer online (over a network) or offline (such as via Azure Import/Export service).
- Consistency checks, which is the method of verifying integrity of backed up data.

When deciding which protected workloads should belong to the same protected groups, some of the most common approaches include:

- By computer. This combines all data sources for a computer into the same protection group.
- By workload. This separates files and each application data type into different protection groups. However, recovering a server hosting multiple workloads might require multiple restores from different protection groups.
- By RPO and RTO. This method groups data sources with similar RPOs. You control the RPO by setting the synchronization frequency for the protection group, which determines the amount of potential data loss (measured in time) during unexpected outages. In the scenario described in this reference architecture document, you control the RTO by setting the retention period within the short-term storage. This is because this determines the period during which backups can be restored from the local short-term storage, rather than from the cloud-based long-term storage. Backing up from the local short-term storage results in a faster restore.
- By data characteristics. This approach accounts for frequency of data changes, data growth rate, or its storage requirements as the criteria for groupings.

When naming protection groups, use a unique, meaningful name. The names can consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters and can include spaces, but cannot exceed 64 characters in length.

In addition, when you create a protection group you must choose a method for creating the initial replica. The initial replication copies all the data selected for protection to the server hosting MABS, and then copies it to the Azure Site Recovery vault. (Each stage is also followed by a consistency check.) MABS can create replicas automatically over the network, but you have the option to create replicas manually by backing up, transferring, and restoring data offline.

When choosing a replica creation method, refer to the information available at [Initial replication over the network][system-center-initial-replication], including a table that provides estimates of how long MABS would take to create a replica automatically over the network given different protected data sizes and network speeds.

The offline-seeding process supports the Azure Import/Export service. The Azure Import/Export service provides the ability to transfer data to an Azure Storage account by using SATA disks. This capability accommodates scenarios in which customers have terabytes of initial backup data and a low-bandwidth network connection to Azure.

The offline-seeding workflow involves the following  high-level steps:

1. A customer copies the initial backup data to one or more SATA disks by using the AzureOfflineBackupDiskPrep tool.
1. The tool automatically generates an Azure Import job and an Azure AD app in the subscription hosting the target Azure Storage account and Azure Recovery Services vault. The purpose of the app is to provide Azure Backup with secure and scoped access to the Azure Import Service, required by the offline seeding process.
1. The customer ships SATA drives to the Azure datacenter hosting the target Azure Storage account.
1. Azure datacenter staff copies data from SATA disks to the Azure Storage account.
1. The workflow triggers a copy from the Azure Storage account to the Azure Recovery Services vault.

### Testing restores

In addition to an optimally designed and implemented backup strategy, it is equally important to define, document, and test the proper restore process for each type of protected workload. While MABS provides built-in consistency checks that automatically verify integrity of backed up data, testing of restores should be part of routine operating procedures, which validate that integrity based on the state of restored workloads. Results of such validation should be available to workload owners.

In general, testing restores tends to be challenging because it requires an environment that closely resembles the one hosting protected workloads. Azure Stack Hub, with its built-in DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code capabilities, considerably simplifies addressing this challenge.

### Roles and responsibilities

Planning for and implementing backup and restore of Azure Stack Hub–based workloads typically involves interaction among a number of stakeholders:

- Azure Stack Hub operators. Azure Stack Hub operators manage Azure Stack Hub infrastructure, ensuring that there are sufficient compute, storage, and network resources for implementing a comprehensive backup and restore solution, and making these resources available to tenants. They also collaborate with application and data owners to help determine the optimal approach to deploying their workloads to Azure Stack Hub.
- Azure administrators. Azure administrators manage Azure resources necessary for implementing hybrid backup solutions.
- Azure AD administrators. Azure AD administrators manage Azure AD resources, including user and group objects that are used to provision, configure, and manage Azure resources.
- Azure Stack Hub tenant IT staff. These stakeholders design, implement, and manage MABS, including its backups and restores.
- Azure Stack Hub users. These users provide RPO and RTO requirements and submit requests to back up and restore data and applications.

## Security considerations

Managing user data and applications in hybrid scenarios warrants additional security considerations. These considerations can be grouped into the following categories:

- Backup encryption
- Azure Recovery Services vault protection

MABS and Azure Backup enforce encryption of backups at rest and in transit:

- Encryption at rest. One of the steps during MABS installation involves providing a passphrase, which is subsequently used to encrypt all backups before they are uploaded to an Azure Recovery Services vault. Decryption takes place only after backups are downloaded from that vault. The passphrase is available only to the user who created the passphrase and the locally installed MARS agent. It's critical to ensure that the passphrase is stored in a secure location, because it serves as the authorization mechanism when performing cloud-based restores on a MABS server different from the one where the backups took place.
- Encryption in transit. MABS v3 relies on Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2 to protect its connections to Azure.

Azure Recovery Services vault offers a number of mechanisms that further protect online backups, including:

- Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). Azure RBAC allows for delegating and segregating responsibilities according to the principle of least privilege. There are three Azure Backup-related built-in roles that restrict access to backup management operations:
  - Backup Contributor. Provides access to create and manage backups, with the exception of deleting Recovery Services vault and delegating access to others.
  - Backup Operator. Provides access equivalent to that of the Backup Contributor, with the exception of removing backups and managing backup policies.
  - Backup Reader. Provides access to monitor backup management operations.
- Azure Resource Locks. You have the option to create and assign read-only and delete locks to an Azure Site Recovery vault to mitigate the risk of the vault being accidentally or maliciously changed or deleted.
- Soft delete. Soft delete helps protect vault and backup data from accidental or malicious deletions. With soft delete, if a user deletes a backup item, the corresponding data is retained for an additional 14 days, allowing for its recovery with no data loss during that period. The additional 14-day retention of backup data in the soft delete state doesn't incur any cost. Soft delete is enabled by default.
- Protection of security-sensitive operations. The Azure Recovery Services vault automatically implements an additional layer of authentication whenever a security-sensitive operation—such as changing a passphrase—is attempted. This extra validation helps ensure that only authorized users are performing these operations.
- Suspicious activity monitoring and alerts. Azure Backup provides built-in monitoring and alerting of security-sensitive events related to Azure Backup operations. Backup Reports facilitate usage tracking, auditing of backups and restores, and identifying key backup trends.

## DevOps considerations

While backup and restore are considered part of IT operations, there are some DevOps-specific considerations that are worth incorporating into a comprehensive backup strategy. Azure Stack Hub facilitates automated deployment of a variety of workloads, including VM-based applications and services. You can leverage this capability to streamline MABS deployment to Azure Stack Hub VMs, which simplifies the initial setup in multitenant scenarios. By combining Azure Resource Manager templates, VM extensions, and the DPM PowerShell module, it is possible to automate configuration of MABS, including setup of its protection groups, retention settings, and backup schedules. In the spirit of the best practices of DevOps, store templates and scripts in a source control and configure their deployment through pipelines. These provisions will also help with minimizing recovery time in scenarios where the infrastructure necessary to restore file and application data needs to be recreated.

## Cost considerations

When considering the cost of the backup solution described in this reference architecture document, remember to account for both on-premises and cloud-based components. The pricing of on-premises components is determined by the Azure Stack Hub pricing model. As with Azure, Azure Stack Hub offers a pay-as-you-use arrangement available through enterprise agreements and the Cloud Solution Provider program. This arrangement includes a monthly price per Windows Server VM. If you have the option to leverage existing Windows Server licenses, you can significantly reduce that cost down to the base VM pricing. While MABS relies on SQL Server as its data store, there is no licensing cost associated with running that SQL Server instance providing it's used exclusively for MABS.

Azure-related charges are associated with use of the following resources:

- Azure Backup. Pricing for Azure Backup is largely determined by the number of protected workloads, and the size of backed-up data (before compression and encryption) for each. The cost is also affected by the choice between locally redundant storage (LRS) and geo-redundant storage (GRS) for the replication of the Azure Recovery Services vault content. For details, refer to [Azure Backup pricing][azure-backup-pricing].
- Azure ExpressRoute. Azure ExpressRoute pricing is based on one of two models:
  - Unlimited data. This is a monthly fee with all inbound and outbound data transfers included.
  - Metered data. This is a monthly fee with all inbound data transfers free of charge and outbound data transfers charged per gigabyte.
- Azure Import/Export. The cost for Azure Import/Export includes a flat, per-device fee for device handling.
- Azure Storage. When using Azure Import/Export, standard Azure Storage rates and transaction fees apply.

Without ExpressRoute, you might have to account for increased bandwidth utilization of your Internet connections, both during backups and restores. The cost will vary depending on a number of factors, including geographical area, current bandwidth usage, and the choice of an Internet service provider.

## Alternative solutions

The recommended solution described in this reference architecture document is understandably not the only way to provide backup and restore functionality to user workloads running on Azure Stack Hub. Customers have other options, including:

- Local backup and restore by using the **Windows Server Backup** feature included in the Windows Server operating system. Users can subsequently copy local backups to a longer-term storage. This approach supports application-consistent backups by relying on Windows VSS providers, but increases local disk space usage and backup maintenance overhead.
- Backup and restore by using Azure Backup with the locally installed MARS agent. This approach minimizes the use of local disk space and automates the process of uploading backups to cloud-based storage. However, it doesn't support application-consistent backups.
- Backup and restore by using a backup solution installed in the same datacenter but outside of Azure Stack Hub. This approach facilitates scenarios that involve an Azure Stack Hub disconnected deployment model.
- Azure Stack Hub–level backup and restore by using disk snapshots. This approach requires that the VM being backed up is stopped, which is typically not a viable option for business-critical workloads, but might be acceptable in some scenarios.

## Summary

In conclusion, Azure Stack Hub is a unique offering, which differs in many aspects from other virtualization platforms. As such, it warrants special considerations in regard to business continuity strategies for workloads running on its VMs. Leveraging Azure services helps simplify the design and implementation strategy. In this architecture reference document, we explored using MABS for backup of file and application data on Azure Stack Hub VMs in the connected deployment model. This approach allows customers to benefit from resiliency and manageability of Azure Stack Hub, and from the hyperscale and global presence of the Azure cloud.

It's important to note that the backup solution described here focuses exclusively on file and application data on Azure Stack Hub VMs. This is just a part of an overall business continuity strategy that should account for a variety of other scenarios affecting workload availability. These could include localized hardware and software failures, system outages, catastrophic events, and large-scale disasters.
