This reference architecture illustrates a logic app that's running in Microsoft Azure, which is triggered by Azure Spring Apps. It then connects to on-premises resources such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SharePoint Server.

## Architecture

![The diagram illustrates an Azure Spring Apps resource triggering a Logic App that advances through a workflow that connects to on-premises SQL Server and SharePoint Server resources by using a data gateway.][architectural-diagram]

### Workflow

The architecture consists of the following:

- **[Azure Spring Apps][azure-spring-apps]**. Spring Apps provides a managed service that's designed and optimized specifically for [Spring][spring] microservices that are written in [Java][java].
- **[Azure Logic Apps][azure-logic-app]**. Logic apps are automated workflows that are provided as a scalable cloud service for common enterprise orchestration tasks. Logic apps include [connectors][azure-logic-app-connectors] for many popular cloud services, on-premises products, or other Software-as-a-Service applications. The Logic Apps workflow includes the following features:
  - **[Trigger][azure-logic-app-connectors-queue]** that fires whenever a new [Azure Queue storage][azure-storage-queues] message is received.
  - **[Action][azure-logic-app-actions-parse]** to parse the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) body of the queue message.
  - **[Action][azure-logic-app-connectors-sql]** to query SQL Server for relevant data.
  - **[Action][azure-logic-app-actions-compose]** to compose a response from the collected data.
  - **[Action][azure-logic-app-connectors-sharepoint]** to persist the composed response to a list on the SharePoint Server.
- **[On-premises data gateway][integration-data-gateway]**. An on-premises data gateway is bridge software that connects on-premises data to cloud services. The gateway typically [installs on a dedicated on-premises virtual machine][azure-logic-app-data-gateway-install].
- **[SQL Server][sql-server]**. This is an installation of SQL Server.
- **[SharePoint Server][sharepoint-server]**. This is an installation of SharePoint Server.

### Components

Key technologies used to implement this architecture:

- [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/spring-apps) is a fully managed service for Spring developers. Manage the lifecycle of your Spring Boot applications with comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, and blue-green deployments.
- [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/logic-apps) is a leading integration platform as a service (iPaaS) built on a containerized runtime. Deploy and run Logic Apps anywhere to increase scale and portability while automating business-critical workflows anywhere.
- [Azure Queue storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/queues) is a simple, cost-effective, durable message queueing for large workloads.

## Scenario details

### Potential use cases

Typical uses for this architecture include:

- Cloud-based Azure Logic Apps workflows that require data from on-premises software as part of their run.
- Extending the capabilities of existing on-premises software by triggering Logic Apps workflows in the cloud.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have specific requirements that override them.

### On-premises data gateway

While it's possible to expose your on-premises servers to the public internet, it's preferable to use an [on-premises data gateway][integration-data-gateway]. This gateway creates a secure read/write connection between your on-premises data sources and Azure. The on-premises data gateway is used with Logic Apps [connectors][azure-logic-app-connectors-list] to [connect][azure-logic-app-data-gateway-connect] local data sources to Azure. Before [installing an on-premises data gateway][integration-data-gateway-installation], consider the following:

- You can install an on-premises data gateway on any on-premises virtual machine. You can choose to install it on the same virtual machine as your server applications or on a co-located virtual machine with the appropriate network connectivity.
- The [architecture of the on-premises data gateway][integration-data-gateway-architecture] is designed to make outbound connections to [Azure Service Bus][azure-relay].
- Review the [additional considerations][integration-data-gateway-installation-considerations] for installing an on-premises data gateway.

An on-premises data gateway can be used with more than just Logic Apps. It's possible to use the same data gateway [installation][azure-logic-app-data-gateway-install] with:

- [Power BI][power-bi]
- [Power Automate][power-automate]
- [Power Apps][power-apps]
- [Azure Analysis Services][azure-analysis-services]

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

### Scalability

- As the amount of Logic Apps flows increase, consider the capacity constraints of the on-premises servers. You'll need to determine if the on-premises servers can handle the increased workload.

### Availability

- Avoid single point of failure issues for an on-premises data gateway by [installing the software on multiple on-premises virtual machines][azure-logic-app-data-gateway-availability].
- Consider implementing high availability topologies for your on-premises servers by using techniques such as:
  - [High availability architecture for SharePoint Server][sharepoint-server-availability]
  - [SQL Server AlwaysOn][sql-server-alwayson]

### Manageability

- [Service Bus][azure-relay] is used for outbound data gateway communication. This might require configuring your firewall to [allow outbound connections to Azure][integration-data-gateway-installation-outbound].
- Consider [Azure ExpressRoute][azure-expressroute] if you want consistent throughput from your on-premises data sources to Azure.

### DevOps

- The corresponding Azure resource for an on-premises data gateway should only be created after the corresponding software is installed on an on-premises virtual machine.
- Consider storing workflow configuration as a [JSON template][azure-logic-app-schema] within an [Azure Resource Manager template][azure-logic-app-arm] to automate deployment.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

- While it's possible to expose your on-premises servers to the public internet, it's preferable to use an on-premises data gateway. This  gateway creates a secure read/write connection between your on-premises data sources and Azure.

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

- Use the [Azure pricing calculator][azure-pricing-calculator] to estimate costs.
- This reference assumes that the [consumption plan][azure-logic-app-consumption-plan] is used to create a global Logic Apps resource.
- This reference only uses standard connectors, which are metered at a lower price than enterprise connectors.
