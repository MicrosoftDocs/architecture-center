This reference architecture shows a microservices application deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It describes a basic AKS configuration that you can use as the starting point for most deployments. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes. The article primarily highlights the infrastructure and DevOps aspects of how to manage microservices on AKS. For more information about how to design microservices, see [Microservices architecture design](../../../microservices/index.yml).

![GitHub logo.](../../../_images/github.png) A reference implementation of this architecture is available on [GitHub][reference-implementation].

## Architecture

:::image type="complex" border="false" source="./images/microservices-architecture.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the microservices on AKS reference architecture." lightbox="./images/microservices-architecture.svg":::
   The diagram shows the microservices on the AKS reference architecture. It depicts an application composed of multiple microservices deployed to AKS. The request flow uses the publisher-subscriber, competing consumers, and gateway routing cloud design patterns. The flow starts with the client application sending a JSON payload over HTTPS to the load balancer's public fully qualified domain name to schedule a drone pickup. The load balancer routes the request to the ingestion microservice, which processes and queues delivery requests in an Azure Service Bus queue. The workflow microservice then consumes messages from the Service Bus queue and sends HTTPS requests to multiple microservices. These services include the drone scheduler, delivery, and package microservices. The delivery microservice stores data in Azure Cache for Redis, and the package microservice stores data in MongoDB. An HTTPS GET request returns the delivery status. It passes through the load balancer to the delivery microservice, which reads data from Azure Cache for Redis.

If you want to see an example of a more advanced microservice that's built on the [AKS baseline architecture](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline), see the [advanced AKS microservices architecture](./aks-microservices-advanced.yml).

### Workflow

This request flow implements the [publisher-subscriber](/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber), [competing consumers](/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers), and [gateway routing](/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-routing) cloud design patterns.

The following dataflow corresponds to the previous diagram:

1. The client application sends a JSON payload over HTTPS to the public fully qualified domain name of the load balancer (managed ingress controller) to schedule a drone pickup.

    - The managed ingress controller routes the request to the ingestion microservice.

    - The ingestion microservice processes the request and queues delivery requests in an Azure Service Bus queue.

1. The workflow microservice:

    - Consumes message information from the Service Bus message queue.

    - Sends an HTTPS request to the delivery microservice, which passes data to external data storage in Azure Cache for Redis.

    - Sends an HTTPS request to the drone scheduler microservice.

    - Sends an HTTPS request to the package microservice, which passes data to external data storage in MongoDB.

1. An HTTPS GET request returns the delivery status. This request passes through the managed ingress controller into the delivery microservice. Then the delivery microservice reads data from Azure Cache for Redis.

### Components

- **[AKS](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-kubernetes-service)** is a managed Kubernetes cluster hosted in the Azure cloud. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure.

- **An ingress server** exposes HTTP(S) routes to services inside the cluster. The reference implementation uses a [managed NGINX-based ingress controller](/azure/aks/app-routing) through an application routing add-on. The ingress controller implements the [API gateway](#api-gateway) pattern for microservices.

- **External data stores**, such as [Azure SQL Database](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-sql-database-well-architected-framework) or [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/cosmos-db), are used by stateless microservices to write their data and other state information. The reference implementation uses [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/), [Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/), [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction) and [Service Bus](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) as data stores or places to store state.

- **[Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis)** is required for the AKS cluster. It provides a [managed identity](/azure/aks/use-managed-identity) that's used to access Azure Container Registry and to access and provision Azure resources like load balancers and managed disks. Workloads deployed on an AKS cluster also each require an identity in Microsoft Entra to access Microsoft Entra-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault and Microsoft Graph. In this reference architecture, [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) integrates with Kubernetes and provides workloads with identities. You can also use managed identities or application credentials for each workload.

- **Container Registry** can be used to store private container images, which are deployed to the cluster. AKS can authenticate with Container Registry by using its Microsoft Entra identity. In the reference implementation, microservice container images are built and pushed to Container Registry.  

- **Azure Pipelines** is part of the Azure DevOps suite and runs automated builds, tests, and deployments. A [continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)](/azure/architecture/microservices/ci-cd) approach is highly encouraged in microservice environments. Various teams can independently build and deploy microservices to AKS by using Azure Pipelines.

- **Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes that provides a mechanism to bundle and standardize Kubernetes objects into a single unit that can be published, deployed, versioned, and updated.

- **Azure Monitor** collects and stores metrics and logs, application telemetry, and platform metrics for Azure services. Azure Monitor integrates with AKS to collect metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

- **Application Insights** monitors microservices and containers. It can be used to provide observability to microservices, which includes traffic flow, end-to-end latency, and error percentage. The health of the microservices and the relationships between them can be displayed on a single application map.  

### Alternatives

[Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/) provides a managed serverless Kubernetes experience. It serves as a simpler alternative to AKS for hosting microservices when you don't need direct access to Kubernetes or its APIs and don't require control over the cluster infrastructure.

Instead of the managed ingress gateway in AKS, you can use alternatives like Application Gateway for Containers, Istio ingress gateway, or non-Microsoft solutions. For more information, see [Ingress in AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-network-ingress).

You can store container images in non-Microsoft container registries such as Docker Hub.

For microservices that need to maintain state information, [Dapr](/azure/aks/dapr-overview) provides an abstraction layer for managing microservice state.

You can use GitHub Actions to build and deploy microservices, or choose non-Microsoft CI/CD solutions like Jenkins.

Microservice observability can be achieved with alternative tools like [Kiali](https://kiali.io/).

## Scenario details

The example [microservice reference implementation](https://github.com/mspnp/microservices-reference-implementation) implements the architectural components and practices described in this article. In this example, a fictitious company called Fabrikam, Inc., manages a fleet of drone aircraft. Businesses register with the service, and users can request a drone to pick up goods for delivery. When a customer schedules a pickup, the back-end system assigns a drone and notifies the user with an estimated delivery time. When the delivery is in progress, the customer can track the drone's location with a continuously updated estimated delivery time.

The scenario aims to demonstrate the microservices architecture and deployment best practices in AKS.

### Potential use cases

Adopt the following best practices from the scenario to architect complex microservices-based applications in AKS:

- Complex web applications
- Business logic developed by using microservice design principles

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Design

This reference architecture is focused on microservices, but many of the recommended practices apply to other workloads that run on AKS.

#### Microservices

A microservice is a loosely coupled, independently deployable unit of code. Microservices typically communicate through well-defined APIs and are discoverable through some form of service discovery. The Kubernetes service object is a typical way to model microservices in Kubernetes.

#### Data storage

In a microservices architecture, services shouldn't share data storage solutions. Each service should manage its own dataset to avoid hidden dependencies among services. Data separation helps avoid unintentional coupling between services. This process can happen when services share the same underlying data schemas. When services manage their own data stores, they can use the correct data store for their particular requirements. For more information, see [Data considerations for microservices](../../../microservices/design/data-considerations.yml).

Avoid storing persistent data in local cluster storage because that method binds the data to the node. Instead, use an external service such as SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB. Another option is to mount a persistent data volume to a solution by using Azure Disk Storage or Azure Files. For more information, see [Storage options for applications in AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-storage).

#### API gateway

API gateways are a general [microservices design pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html). An API gateway sits between external clients and the microservices. The gateway serves as a reverse proxy and routes requests from clients to microservices. An API gateway might also perform various cross-cutting tasks such as authentication, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) termination, and rate limiting. For more information, see the following resources:

- [Use API gateways in microservices](/azure/architecture/microservices/design/gateway)

- [Choose an API gateway technology](/azure/architecture/microservices/design/gateway#choose-an-api-gateway-technology)

In Kubernetes, an ingress controller primarily handles the functionality of an API gateway. The ingress and ingress controller work in conjunction to:

- Route client requests to the correct back-end microservices. This routing provides a single endpoint for clients and helps to decouple clients from services.

- Aggregate multiple requests into a single request to reduce chattiness between the client and the back end.

- Offload functionality from the back-end services, such as SSL termination, authentication, IP address restrictions, or client rate limiting (called *throttling*).

There are ingress controllers for reverse proxies, which include NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik, and Azure Application Gateway. AKS provides multiple managed ingress options. You can choose from a [managed NGINX-based ingress controller](/azure/aks/app-routing) through the application routing add-on, Application Gateway for Containers. Or you can choose Istio ingress gateway as the ingress controller. For more information, see [Ingress in AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-network-ingress).

The ingress resources Kubernetes objects have been replaced by the more advanced and versatile Kubernetes Gateway API. Ingress controller and Gateway API are both Kubernetes objects used for traffic management routing and load balancing. Designed to be generic, expressive, extensible, and role oriented, the Gateway API is a modern set of APIs for defining L4 and L7 routing rules in Kubernetes.

The ingress controller operates as the edge router or reverse proxy. A reverse proxy server is a potential bottleneck or single point of failure, so we recommend that you deploy at least two replicas to help ensure high availability.

#### When to choose ingress controllers or Gateway API

Ingress resources are suitable for the following use cases:

- Ingress controllers are easy to set up and are suited for smaller and less complex Kubernetes deployments that prioritize easy configuration.

- If you currently have ingress controllers configured in your Kubernetes cluster and they meet your requirements effectively, there might not be an immediate need to transition to the Kubernetes Gateway API.

You should use Gateway API:

- When you deal with complex routing configurations, traffic splitting, and advanced traffic management strategies. The flexibility provided by Kubernetes Gateway API's Route resources is essential.

- If networking requirements need custom solutions or the integration of non-Microsoft plugins. The Kubernetes Gateway API's approach, based on custom resource definitions, can provide enhanced extensibility.

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist).

#### Partitioning microservices

Use namespaces to organize services within the cluster. Every object in a Kubernetes cluster belongs to a namespace. It's a good practice to use namespaces to organize the resources in the cluster.

Namespaces help prevent naming collisions. When multiple teams deploy microservices into the same cluster, with possibly hundreds of microservices, it gets hard to manage if they all go into the same namespace. Namespaces also allow you to:

- Apply resource constraints to a namespace so that the total set of pods assigned to that namespace can't exceed the resource quota of the namespace.

- Apply policies at the namespace level, which include role-based access control (RBAC) and security policies.

When multiple teams develop and deploy microservices, you can use namespaces as a convenient mechanism to control areas that each team can deploy to. For example, development team A can be given access only to namespace A, and development team B can be given access only to namespace B through Kubernetes [RBAC policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole).

For a microservices architecture, consider organizing the microservices into bounded contexts and creating namespaces for each bounded context. For example, all microservices related to the "Order Fulfillment" bounded context can go into the same namespace. Alternatively, create a namespace for each development team.

Place utility services into their own separate namespace. For example, you might deploy cluster monitoring tools such as Elasticsearch and Prometheus to a monitoring namespace.

#### Health probes

Kubernetes defines three types of health probes that a pod can expose:

- **Readiness probe:** Tells Kubernetes whether the pod is ready to accept requests.

- **Liveness probe:** Tells Kubernetes whether a pod should be removed and a new instance started.
  
- **Startup probe:** Tells Kubernetes whether the pod is started.

When you think about probes, it's important to remember how a service works in Kubernetes. A service has a label selector that matches a set of zero or more pods. Kubernetes load balances traffic to the pods that match the selector. Only pods that start successfully and are healthy receive traffic. If a container crashes, Kubernetes terminates the pod and schedules a replacement.

Sometimes a pod might not be ready to receive traffic, even though it has started successfully. For example, there might be initialization tasks underway, such as when the application running in the container loads data into memory or reads configuration files. You can use a startup probe for these slow-starting containers. This approach helps prevent Kubernetes from terminating them before they have a chance to fully initialize.

Liveness probes are used to check if a pod is running but not working properly and needs to be restarted. For instance, if a container is handling HTTP requests but suddenly stops responding without crashing, the liveness probe detects this event and triggers a restart of the pod. If you set up a liveness probe, it notices when a container isn't responding and prompts Kubernetes to restart the pod if the container repeatedly fails the probe.

Consider the following points when you design probes for microservices.

- If your code has a long startup time, there's a danger that a liveness probe reports failure before the startup completes. To delay the start of a liveness probe, use the startup probe, or use the `initialDelaySeconds` setting with the liveness probe.

- A liveness probe only helps if restarting the pod is likely to restore it to a healthy state. You can use a liveness probe to mitigate memory leaks or unexpected deadlocks, but there's no reason to restart a pod that's going to immediately fail again.

- Sometimes readiness probes are used to check dependent services. For example, if a pod has a dependency on a database, the probe might check the database connection. However, this approach can create unexpected problems. An external service might be temporarily unavailable. This unavailability causes the readiness probe to fail for all the pods in your service, which results in their removal from load balancing. This removal creates cascading failures upstream. 

   A better approach is to implement retry handling within your service so that your service can recover correctly from transient failures. As an alternative, retry handling, error tolerance, and circuit breakers can be implemented by the [Istio service mesh](/azure/aks/istio-about) to create resilient architecture that can handle microservice failures.

#### Resource constraints

Resource contention can affect the availability of a service. Define [resource constraints for containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) so that a single container can't overwhelm the cluster resources, like memory and CPU. For non-container resources, such as threads or network connections, consider using the [Bulkhead pattern](../../../patterns/bulkhead.yml) to isolate resources.

Use [resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) to limit the total resources allowed for a namespace. This limitation ensures that the front end can't starve the back-end services for resources or vice-versa. Resource quotas can help allocate resources within the same cluster to multiple microservice development teams.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Security](/azure/well-architected/security/checklist).

#### TLS and SSL encryption

In many implementations, the ingress controller is used for SSL termination. As part of deploying the ingress controller, you need to create or import a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate. Only use self-signed certificates for development and test purposes. For more information, see [Set up a custom domain name and SSL certificate with the application routing add-on](/azure/aks/app-routing-dns-ssl).

For production workloads, get signed certificates from trusted certificate authorities.

You might also need to rotate your certificates depending on the organization's policies. You can use Key Vault to rotate certificates that microservices use. For more information, see [Configure certificate auto-rotation in Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates).

#### RBAC

When multiple teams develop and deploy microservices at the same time, AKS RBAC mechanisms can provide granular control and filtering of user actions. You can either use Kubernetes RBAC or Azure RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID to control access to the cluster resources. For more information, see [Access and identity options for AKS](/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-role-based-access-control).

#### Authentication and authorization

Microservices can require the consuming services or users to authenticate and authorize access to the microservice by using certificates, credentials, and RBAC mechanisms. Microsoft Entra ID can be used to implement [OAuth 2.0 tokens for authorization](/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2). Service meshes such as [Istio](/azure/aks/istio-about) also provide authorization and authentication mechanisms for microservices, which include OAuth token validation and token-based routing. The reference implementation doesn't cover microservice authentication and authorization scenarios.  

#### Secrets management and application credentials

Applications and services often need credentials that allow them to connect to external services such as Azure Storage or SQL Database. The challenge is to keep these credentials safe and not leak them.

For Azure resources, use managed identities when possible. A managed identity is like a unique ID for an application or service that's stored in Microsoft Entra ID. It uses this identity to authenticate with an Azure service. The application or service has a service principal created for it in Microsoft Entra ID and authenticates by using OAuth 2.0 tokens. The code running within the process can transparently obtain the token. This approach helps ensure that you don't need to store any passwords or connection strings. To use managed identities, you can assign Microsoft Entra identities to individual pods in AKS by using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview).

Even when you use managed identities, you might still need to store some credentials or other application secrets. This storage is necessary for Azure services that don't support managed identities, non-Microsoft services, or API keys. You can use the following options to help store secrets more securely:

- **Key Vault:** In AKS, you can mount one or more secrets from Key Vault as a volume. The volume reads the secrets from Key Vault. The pod can then read the secrets like a regular volume. For more information, see [Use the Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI driver in an AKS cluster](/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver). The pod authenticates itself by using either a workload identity or a user or system-assigned managed identity. For more information, see [Connect your Azure identity provider to the Key Vault Secrets Store CSI Driver in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-identity-access).

- **HashiCorp Vault:** Microsoft Entra managed identities allow Kubernetes applications to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault. You can [deploy the vault to Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-azure-aks). Consider running it in a separate dedicated cluster from your application cluster.

- **Kubernetes secrets:** Another option is to use Kubernetes secrets. This option is the easiest to configure but the least secure. Secrets are stored in etcd, which is a distributed key-value store. AKS [encrypts etcd at rest](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-kms#azure-kubernetes-service-aks). Microsoft manages the encryption keys.

Using a solution like Key Vault provides several advantages, including:

- Centralized control of secrets.
- Helping to ensure that all secrets are encrypted at rest.
- Centralized key management.
- Access control of secrets.
- Key lifecycle management.
- Auditing.

The reference implementation stores Azure Cosmos DB connection strings and other secrets in Key Vault. The reference implementation uses a managed identity for microservices to authenticate to Key Vault and access secrets.  

#### Container and orchestrator security

The following recommended practices can help secure your pods and containers.

- **Monitor for threats.** Monitor for threats by using [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction) or a non-Microsoft capability. If you host containers on a virtual machine (VM), use [Microsoft Defender for Servers](/azure/security-center/defender-for-servers-introduction) or a non-Microsoft capability. Additionally, you can integrate logs from [Container monitoring solution in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/containers) to [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/) or an existing security information and event management (SIEM) solution.

- **Monitor vulnerabilities.** Continuously monitor images and running containers for known vulnerabilities by using [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/container-security) or a non-Microsoft solution.

- **Automate image patching.** Use [Azure Container Registry tasks](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tasks-overview), a feature of Container Registry, to automate image patching. A container image is built up from layers. The base layers include the OS image and application framework images, such as ASP.NET Core or Node.js. The base images are typically created upstream from the application developers, and other project maintainers maintain them. When these images are patched upstream, it's important to update, test, and redeploy your own images so that you don't leave any known security vulnerabilities. Azure Container Registry tasks can help to automate this process.

- **Store images in a trusted private registry.** Use a trusted private registry such as Container Registry or Docker Trusted Registry to store images. Use a validating admission webhook in Kubernetes to help ensure that pods can only retrieve images from the trusted registry.

- **Apply the principle of least privilege.** Don't run containers in privileged mode. Privileged mode gives a container access to all devices on the host. When possible, avoid running processes as root inside containers. Containers don't provide complete isolation from a security standpoint, so it's better to run a container process as a non-privileged user.

### Deployment CI/CD considerations

Consider the following goals of a robust CI/CD process for a microservices architecture:

- Each team can build and deploy the services that it owns independently, without affecting or disrupting other teams.

- Before a new version of a service is deployed to production, it's deployed to development, test, and Q&A environments for validation. Quality gates are enforced at each stage.

- A new version of a service can be deployed side by side with the previous version.

- Sufficient access control policies are in place.

- For containerized workloads, you can trust the container images that are deployed to production.

To learn more about the challenges, see [CI/CD for microservices architectures](../../../microservices/ci-cd.yml).

Using a service mesh like Istio can help with CI/CD processes, like canary deployments, A/B testing of microservices, and staged rollouts with percentage-based traffic splits.

For more information about specific recommendations and best practices, see [Build a CI/CD pipeline for microservices on Kubernetes with Azure DevOps and Helm](../../../microservices/ci-cd-kubernetes.yml).

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

Use the [Azure pricing calculator][azure-pricing-calculator] to estimate costs. Other considerations are described in the **Cost** section in [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework][aaf-cost].

Consider the following points for some of the services used in this architecture.

#### AKS

- In the [free tier](/azure/aks/free-standard-pricing-tiers), there are no costs associated for AKS in deployment, management, and operations of the Kubernetes cluster. You only pay for the VM instances, storage, and networking resources that your Kubernetes cluster consumes.

- Consider using [horizontal pod autoscaler](/azure/aks/concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) to automatically scale microservices in or scale them out depending on load.

- Configure [cluster autoscaler](/azure/aks/concepts-scale#cluster-autoscaler) to scale the nodes in or scale them out depending on load.

- Consider using [spot nodes](/azure/aks/spot-node-pool) to host noncritical microservices.

- Review the [cost optimization best practices for AKS](/azure/aks/best-practices-cost).

- To estimate the cost of the required resources, use the [AKS calculator][aks-calculator].

#### Azure Load Balancer

You're charged only for the number of configured load-balancing and outbound rules. Inbound network address translation rules are free. There's no hourly charge for the Standard Load Balancer when no rules are configured. For more information, see [Azure Load Balancer pricing][az-lb-pricing].

#### Azure Pipelines

This reference architecture only uses Azure Pipelines. Azure provides the pipeline as an individual service. You're allowed a free Microsoft-hosted job with 1,800 minutes for each month for CI/CD and one self-hosted job with unlimited minutes for each month. Extra jobs incur more costs. For more information, see [Azure DevOps services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services).

#### Azure Monitor

For Azure Monitor Log Analytics, you're charged for data ingestion and retention. For more information, see [Azure Monitor pricing][az-monitor-pricing].

### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Operational Excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist).

This reference architecture includes [Bicep files](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) for provisioning cloud resources and their dependencies. You can use [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/user-guide/services) to deploy these Bicep files and quickly set up different environments, such as replicating production scenarios. This approach helps you save costs by provisioning load testing environments only when needed.

Consider following the workload isolation criteria to structure your Bicep file. A workload is typically defined as an arbitrary unit of functionality. For example, you can have a separate Bicep file for the cluster and then another file for the dependent services. You can use Azure DevOps to perform CI/CD with workload isolation because each workload is associated and managed by its own team.
