With more companies adhering to the [API-first approach](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/) for their internal applications, and the growing number and severity of threats to web applications over the internet, it's critical to have a security strategy to protect APIs. The first step toward API security is restricting who can access what aspects of an API, and from which locations. This article describes how to use Azure Application Gateway and Azure API Management to protect API access.

## Architecture

This article doesn't address the application's underlying services, like App Service Environment, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Kubernetes Services. Those parts of the diagram only showcase what you can do as a broader solution. This article specifically discusses the shaded areas, API Management and Application Gateway.

- Application Gateway sets up a URL redirection mechanism that sends the request to the proper [backend pool](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-components#backend-pools), depending on the URL format of the API call:
  
  - URLs formatted like `api.<some-domain>/external/*` can reach the back end to interact with the requested APIs.
  
  - Calls formatted as `api.<some-domain>/*` go to a dead end, which is a back-end pool with no target.
  
- API Management accepts and properly maps internal calls, which come from resources in the same Azure virtual network, under `api.<some-domain>/internal/*`.
  
- Finally, at the API Management level, APIs are set up to accept calls under the following patterns:
  
  - `api.<some-domain>/external/*`
  - `api.<some-domain>/internal/*`
  
  In this scenario, API Management uses two types of IP addresses, public and private. Public IP addresses are for internal communication on port 3443, and for runtime API traffic in the external virtual network configuration. When API Management sends a request to a public internet-facing back end, it shows a public IP address as the origin of the request. For more information, see [IP addresses of API Management service in VNet](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-ip-addresses#ip-addresses-of-api-management-service-in-vnet).
  
- A rule at the Application Gateway level properly redirects users under `portal.<some-domain>/*` to the developer portal, so that developers can manage APIs and their configurations from both internal and external environments.

### Components

- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/) enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

- [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/) is a web traffic load balancer that manages traffic to web applications. Load balancers operate at the transport layer, OSI layer 4 TCP and UDP, and route traffic based on source IP address and port to a destination IP address and port.

- [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/) is a hybrid, multi-cloud management platform for APIs across all environments. API Management creates consistent, modern API gateways for existing backend services.

## Recommendations

- This solution focuses on implementing the whole solution, and testing API access from inside and outside the API Management virtual network. For more information about the API Management virtual network integration process, see [Integrate API Management in an internal VNET with Application Gateway](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-integrate-internal-vnet-appgateway).

- This solution doesn't cover product creation and API configuration in API Management. For a comprehensive tutorial covering those tasks, see [Tutorial: Create and publish a product](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products).

- To communicate with private resources in the back end, Application Gateway and API Management must be in the same virtual network as the resources. Before implementing the solution, set up a virtual network for your resources. The solution creates subnets for Application Gateway and API Management.

- The private, internal deployment model allows API Management to connect to an existing virtual network, making it reachable from the inside of that network context. To enable this feature, deploy either the **Development** or **Production** API Management tiers.
  
- Application Gateway requires PFX certificates for SSL termination. Make sure these certificates are in place before you implement the solution.

- Manage certificates and passwords in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts).

- To personalize interactions with the services, you can use [CNAME entries](/azure/dns/dns-web-sites-custom-domain).

- You can use other services to deliver the same level of firewall and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection:
  
  - [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)
  - [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview)
  - Partner solutions like [Barracuda](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/barracudanetworks.waf?tab=overview)
  - Other solutions available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/)

## Scalability considerations

- Application Gateway is the entry point for this architecture, and the WAF feature requires additional processing power for each request analysis. To allow Application Gateway to expand its computational capacity on the spot, it's important to enable autoscaling. For more information, see [Specify autoscale](/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-autoscale-ps#specify-autoscale).

- Consider Application Gateway subnet sizing. Application Gateway requests one private address per instance, and another private IP address if a private front-end IP is configured. Application Gateway also takes five IPs per instance from its subnet. To properly deploy Application Gateway for this architecture, make sure its subnet has enough space to grow. For more information, see [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure).

- To support highly concurrent scenarios, turn on API Management autoscaling. Autoscaling quickly expands API Management capabilities in response to growing numbers of incoming requests. For more information, see [Automatically scale an Azure API Management instance](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-autoscale).

## Availability considerations

- Azure Application Gateway is always deployed in a highly available fashion. If a certain instance stops functioning, Application Gateway transparently creates a new instance. To avoid downtime when creating new instances, you can configure the Application Gateway or WAF deployment to span multiple Availability Zones, making it more resilient to zone failure. For more information, see [Autoscaling and High Availability](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant#autoscaling-and-high-availability).

- Enable zone redundancy for your API Management instance to provide resiliency and high availability. Zone redundancy replicates the API Management gateway and control plane across datacenters in physically separated zones, making them resilient to zone failure. Zone redundancy requires the API Management **Premium** tier.
  
  API Management also supports multi-region deployments, which help reduce request latency, and improve availability if one region goes offline. For more information, see [Availability zone support for Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/zone-redundancy).

## Security considerations

- For more information about Application Gateway security, see [Azure security baseline for Application Gateway](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/application-gateway-security-baseline).

- For more information about API Management security, see [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline).

## Deploy the solution

The following deployment steps use PowerShell. You could also use the [Azure portal](/azure/application-gateway/create-url-route-portal) or [Azure CLI](/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-url-redirect-cli) to get the same results.

1. Deploy a new resource group.
   
   ```powershell
   $resGroupName = "<resource-group-name>"
   $location = "<azure-region>"
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resGroupName -Location $location
   ```
   
1. Add subnets for API Management and Application Gateway.
   
   ```powershell
   # Retrieve virtual network information
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name <vnet-name>  -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name>
   
   # Add the appgtw-subnet to the existing virtual network 
   $subnetApplication GatewayConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
   -Name appgtw-subnet `
   -AddressPrefix <subnet-prefix-address> `
   -VirtualNetwork $vnet
   
   # Add the apim-subnet to the existing virtual network 
   $subnetAPIMConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
     -Name apim-subnet `
     -AddressPrefix <subnet-prefix-address> `
     -VirtualNetwork $vnet
   
   # Attach subnets to the virtual network 
   $vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
   
   # Check that subnets were successfully added
   $vnet.Subnets
   
   # Assign subnet to variables
   $appgatewaysubnetdata = $vnet.Subnets[subnet-index]
   $apimsubnetdata = $vnet.Subnets[subnet-index]
   ```
