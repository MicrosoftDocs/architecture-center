With more companies adhering to the [API-first approach](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/) for their internal applications, and the growing number and severity of threats to web applications over the internet, it's critical to have a security strategy to protect APIs. The first step toward API security is restricting who can access what aspects of an API, and from which locations. This article describes how to use Azure Application Gateway and Azure API Management to protect API access.

## Architecture

This article doesn't address the application's underlying services, like App Service Environment, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Kubernetes Services. Those parts of the diagram only showcase what you can do as a broader solution. This article specifically discusses the shaded areas, API Management and Application Gateway.

### Workflow

- Application Gateway sets up a URL redirection mechanism that sends the request to the proper [backend pool](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-components#backend-pools), depending on the URL format of the API call:

  - URLs formatted like `api.<some-domain>/external/*` can reach the back end to interact with the requested APIs.

  - Calls formatted as `api.<some-domain>/*` go to a dead end, which is a back-end pool with no target.

- API Management accepts and properly maps internal calls, which come from resources in the same Azure virtual network, under `api.<some-domain>/internal/*`.

- Finally, at the API Management level, APIs are set up to accept calls under the following patterns:

  - `api.<some-domain>/external/*`
  - `api.<some-domain>/internal/*`

  In this scenario, API Management uses two types of IP addresses, public and private. Public IP addresses are for internal communication on port 3443, and for runtime API traffic in the external virtual network configuration. When API Management sends a request to a public internet-facing back end, it shows a public IP address as the origin of the request. For more information, see [IP addresses of API Management service in VNet](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-ip-addresses#ip-addresses-of-api-management-service-in-vnet).

- A rule at the Application Gateway level properly redirects users under `portal.<some-domain>/*` to the developer portal, so that developers can manage APIs and their configurations from both internal and external environments.

### Components

- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/) enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

- [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/) is a web traffic load balancer that manages traffic to web applications. Load balancers operate at the transport layer, OSI layer 4 TCP and UDP, and route traffic based on source IP address and port to a destination IP address and port.

- [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/) is a hybrid, multi-cloud management platform for APIs across all environments. API Management creates consistent, modern API gateways for existing backend services.

## Recommendations

- This solution focuses on implementing the whole solution, and testing API access from inside and outside the API Management virtual network. For more information about the API Management virtual network integration process, see [Integrate API Management in an internal VNET with Application Gateway](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-integrate-internal-vnet-appgateway).

- This solution doesn't cover product creation and API configuration in API Management. For a comprehensive tutorial covering those tasks, see [Tutorial: Create and publish a product](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products).

- To communicate with private resources in the back end, Application Gateway and API Management must be in the same virtual network as the resources. Before implementing the solution, set up a virtual network for your resources. The solution creates subnets for Application Gateway and API Management.

- The private, internal deployment model allows API Management to connect to an existing virtual network, making it reachable from the inside of that network context. To enable this feature, deploy either the **Developer** or **Premium** API Management tiers.

- Application Gateway requires PFX certificates for SSL termination. Make sure these certificates are in place before you implement the solution.

- Manage certificates and passwords in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts).

- To personalize interactions with the services, you can use [CNAME entries](/azure/dns/dns-web-sites-custom-domain).

- You can use other services to deliver the same level of firewall and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection:

  - [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)
  - [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview)
  - Partner solutions like [Barracuda](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/barracudanetworks.waf?tab=overview)
  - Other solutions available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/)

## Considerations

### Scalability

- Application Gateway is the entry point for this architecture, and the WAF feature requires additional processing power for each request analysis. To allow Application Gateway to expand its computational capacity on the spot, it's important to enable autoscaling. For more information, see [Specify autoscale](/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-autoscale-ps#specify-autoscale).

- Consider Application Gateway subnet sizing. Application Gateway requests one private address per instance, and another private IP address if a private front-end IP is configured. Application Gateway also takes five IPs per instance from its subnet. To properly deploy Application Gateway for this architecture, make sure its subnet has enough space to grow. For more information, see [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure).

- To support highly concurrent scenarios, turn on API Management autoscaling. Autoscaling quickly expands API Management capabilities in response to growing numbers of incoming requests. For more information, see [Automatically scale an Azure API Management instance](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-autoscale).

### Availability

- Azure Application Gateway is always deployed in a highly available fashion. If a certain instance stops functioning, Application Gateway transparently creates a new instance. To avoid downtime when creating new instances, you can configure the Application Gateway or WAF deployment to span multiple Availability Zones, making it more resilient to zone failure. For more information, see [Autoscaling and High Availability](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant#autoscaling-and-high-availability).

- Enable zone redundancy for your API Management instance to provide resiliency and high availability. Zone redundancy replicates the API Management gateway and control plane across datacenters in physically separated zones, making them resilient to zone failure. Zone redundancy requires the API Management **Premium** tier.

  API Management also supports multi-region deployments, which help reduce request latency, and improve availability if one region goes offline. For more information, see [Availability zone support for Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/zone-redundancy).

### Security

- For more information about Application Gateway security, see [Azure security baseline for Application Gateway](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/application-gateway-security-baseline).

- For more information about API Management security, see [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline).

### Cost optimization

The cost of this architecture depends on configuration aspects like:
- Service tiers
- Scalability, meaning the number of instances dynamically allocated by services to support a given demand
- Automation scripts
- Whether this architecture will run continuously or just a few hours a month

After you assess these aspects, go to the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate pricing.

## Deploy this scenario 

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario assumes you already have a virtual network in place. If you need help creating a virtual network, see [Create a virtual network using PowerShell](/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-powershell).

### Deployment with PowerShell

The following deployment steps use PowerShell. You could also use the [Azure portal](/azure/application-gateway/create-url-route-portal) or [Azure CLI](/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-url-redirect-cli) to get the same results.

1. Deploy a new resource group.

   ```powershell
   $resGroupName = "<resource-group-name>"
   $location = "<azure-region>"
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resGroupName -Location $location
   ```

1. Add subnets for API Management and Application Gateway.

   ```powershell
   # Retrieve virtual network information
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name <vnet-name>  -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name>

   # Add the appgtw-subnet to the existing virtual network 
   $subnetApplication GatewayConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
   -Name appgtw-subnet `
   -AddressPrefix <subnet-prefix-address> `
   -VirtualNetwork $vnet

   # Add the apim-subnet to the existing virtual network 
   $subnetAPIMConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
     -Name apim-subnet `
     -AddressPrefix <subnet-prefix-address> `
     -VirtualNetwork $vnet

   # Attach subnets to the virtual network

   $gatewayCertCerPath = "<local-path-to-cer-certificate>"
   $gatewayCertPfxPath = "<local-path-to-pfx-certificate>"
   $portalCertPfxPath = "<local-path-to-pfx-certificate>"
   $gatewayCertPfxPassword = "<cert-api-password>"
   $portalCertPfxPassword = "<cert-portal-password>"

   # Convert to secure string before sending over HTTP
   $certPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $gatewayCertPfxPassword -AsPlainText -Force
   $certPortalPwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $portalCertPfxPassword -AsPlainText -Force

   # Create and set the hostname configuration objects for the proxy and portal
   $proxyHostnameConfig = New-AzApiManagementCustomHostnameConfiguration `
     -Hostname $gatewayHostname `

   # Tie certificates configurations into API Management service
   $apimService.ProxyCustomHostnameConfiguration = $proxyHostnameConfig
   $apimService.PortalCustomHostnameConfiguration = $portalHostnameConfig

   # Update API Management with the updated configuration
   Set-AzApiManagement -InputObject $apimService
   ```

1. Provision a public IP (PIP) for Application Gateway.

   ```powershell
   # Create a public IP address for the Application Gateway front end
   $publicip = New-AzPublicIpAddress `
       -ResourceGroupName $resGroupName `
       -name "<pip-name>" `

          -SslCertificate $certPortal `
          -HostName $portalHostname `
          -RequireServerNameIndication true
      ```

   1. Create Application Gateway probes to map API Management endpoints.

      ```powershell
      # Step 6 - create custom probes for API Management endpoints
      $apimprobe = New-AzApplicationGatewayProbeConfig `
          -Name "apim-api-probe" `
          -Protocol "Https" `
          -HostName $gatewayHostname `

          -Interval 60 `
          -Timeout 300 `
          -UnhealthyThreshold 8
      ```

   1. List API Management endpoints to backend pools.

      ```powershell
      # Step 7 - upload certificate for SSL-enabled backend pool resources
      $authcert = New-AzApplicationGatewayAuthenticationCertificate `
          -Name "whitelistcert" `
          -CertificateFile $gatewayCertCerPath
      ```

   1. Configure Application Gateway HTTPs settings.

      ```powershell
      # Step 8 - configure HTTPs backend settings for the Application Gateway
      $apimPoolSetting = New-AzApplicationGatewayBackendHttpSettings `
          -Name "apim-api-poolsetting" `
          -Port 443 `
          -Protocol "Https" `
          -CookieBasedAffinity "Disabled" `
          -Probe $apimprobe `
          -AuthenticationCertificates $authcert `

      ```

   1. Map backend pool IP to API Management internal IP.

      ```powershell
      # Step 9a - map backend pool IP with API Management internal IP
      $apimProxyBackendPool = New-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool `
          -Name "apimbackend" `
          -BackendIPAddresses $apimService.PrivateIPAddresses[0]

      # Step 9b - create sinkpool for API Management requests to discard 
      $sinkpool = New-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool -Name "sinkpool"

      $apimProxyBackendPool = New-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool `
          -Name "apimbackend" `
          -BackendIPAddresses $apimService.PrivateIPAddresses[0]
      ```

   1. Allow external access to the API Management developer portal.

      ```powershell
      # Step 10 - create a routing rule to allow external internet access to the developer portal
      $rule01 = New-AzApplicationGatewayRequestRoutingRule `
          -Name "apim-portal-rule" `
          -RuleType Basic `
          -HttpListener $portalListener `

      # Step 11 - change Application Gateway SKU and instances (# instances can be configured as required)
      $sku = New-AzApplicationGatewaySku -Name "<waf-sku-name>" -Tier "WAF" -Capacity <instances-number>

      # Step 12 - configure WAF to be in prevention mode
      $config = New-AzApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallConfiguration `
          -Enabled $true `
          -FirewallMode "Detection"
      ```

1. Deploy Application Gateway.

   ```powershell
   # Deploy the Application Gateway
   $appgwName = "<ag-name>"

   $appgw = New-AzApplicationGateway `
       -Name $appgwName `
       -ResourceGroupName $resGroupName `
       -Location $location `
       -BackendAddressPools $apimProxyBackendPool, $sinkpool `

   ```powershell
   # Get existing Application Gateway config
   $appgw = Get-AzApplicationGateway `
       -ResourceGroupName $resGroupName `
       -Name $appgwName

   $listener = Get-AzApplicationGatewayHttpListener `
       -Name "apim-api-listener" `
       -ApplicationGateway $appgw

   $sinkpool = Get-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool `
       -ApplicationGateway $appgw `
       -Name "sinkpool"

   $pool = Get-AzApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool `

   $poolSettings = Get-AzApplicationGatewayBackendHttpSettings `
       -ApplicationGateway $appgw `
       -Name "apim-api-poolsetting"

   $pathRule = New-AzApplicationGatewayPathRuleConfig `
       -Name "external" `
       -Paths "/external/*" `
       -BackendAddressPool $pool `
       -BackendHttpSettings $poolSettings

       -HttpListener $listener `
       -BackendAddressPool $Pool `
       -BackendHttpSettings $poolSettings `
       -UrlPathMap $pathMap
   ```

1. Update Application Gateway with the new configuration.

   ```powershell
   $appgw = Set-AzApplicationGateway `
       -ApplicationGateway $appgw
   ```
### Update an existing Application Gateway via the portal

The following deployment steps use the Azure portal to update an existing Azure Application Gateway to route to an existing API Management instance deployed to a private network.

1. Collect information from your API Management service:
    1. Navigate to your API Management service
    1. From the **Overview** page note the following:
        - Your developer portal URL - ``https://<APIM-name>.developer.azure-api.net``, henceforth *backend portal name*.
        - Your API gateway URL - ``https://<APIM-name>.azure-api.net``, henceforth *backend gateway name*
        - Your Virtual IP (VIP) addresses for the API Management service by navigating to, specifically the private one, henceforth *Private VIP*.

1. Make sure you have your certificates available.  There are two certificate scenarios to consider:
    - *Backend certificates*, which will be configured in the Routing Rule, and used for communication between Application Gateway and the APIM endpoint.
        - If you're using the default domain name of the API management service, you don't need a certificate.  Application Gateway will be able to use the default certificate.
        - If you're using a custom domain that uses a well known certificate authority, such as GoDaddy, you don't need a certificate.  Application Gateway will be able to use the well known certificate authority.
        - If you're using a custom domain and a custom certificate authority that isn't well known, such as a Microsoft public key infrastructure implementation, then follow the instructions to [Create backend certificates](/azure/application-gateway/certificates-for-backend-authentication) to prepare your certificate in advance
    - *Frontend certificates*, which will be configured in the Listener, and used for communication between the client and the Application Gateway.  You have two options:
        - Upload a PFX certificate to the Application Gateway as part of deployment.
        - Upload ta PFX certificate to a Key Vault as a Secret, accessible by a managed identity, as described in [TLS termination with Key Vault certificates](/azure/application-gateway/key-vault-certs).

1. Make sure you have the appropriate DNS setting enabled to direct your domain to your Application Gateway.  
    - Your public domain should match the front end certificate you're using.
    - You should have a record for both the API gateway (henceforth *frontend gateway name*) and the portal (henceforth *frontend portal name*).
    - Both records should point to the **Frontend public IP address** on the **Overview** page of your Application Gateway.

1. Navigate to the Application Gateway resource you wish to change.

1. Prepare the backend pool:
    1. On the Application gateway menu, navigate to the **Backend pools** and select **Add**.  The **Add backend pool** page appears.
    1. Name the backend pool as appropriate, such as  *APIM-Backend*.
    1. In the **IP address or FQDN** target field, provide the *Private VIP* for the APIM service.
    1. Select **Save**.

1. Configure the HTTP settings for the API Gateway frontend:
    1. Navigate to **HTTP setting** and select **Add**.  The **Add HTTP setting** page appears.  
    1. Name the HTTP setting as appropriate, such as *APIM-GW-HTTPSetting*.
    1. Set the backend protocol to *HTTPS*.
    1. Under **Trusted root certificate**:
        - If you're using the default domain name of the API Management service, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *Yes*.
        - If you're using a custom domain that uses a well known certificate authority, such as GoDaddy, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *Yes*.
        - If you're using a custom domain and a custom certificate authority that isn't well known, such as a Microsoft public key infrastructure implementation, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *No*, and then upload the certificate
    1. Under **Host name override**, if you are using a *backend gateway name* that is different from your *frontend gateway name*, select *Override with specific domain name* and place in the domain name of your API gateway - the *backend gateway name*.
    1. Leave **Use custom probe** as *No* - this setting will be changed in a later step.
    1. Select **Save** to save the configuration.

1. Configure the HTTP settings for the API Portal frontend by repeating the previous step, with the following differences:
    1. Navigate to **HTTP setting** and select **Add**.  The **Add HTTP setting** page appears.  
    1. Name the HTTP setting as appropriate, such as *APIM-Portal-HTTPSetting*.
    1. Set the backend protocol to *HTTPS*.
    1. Under **Trusted root certificate**:
        - If you're using the default domain name of the API Management service, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *Yes*.
        - If you're using a custom domain that uses a well known certificate authority, such as GoDaddy, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *Yes*.
        - If you're using a custom domain and a custom certificate authority that isn't well known, such as a Microsoft public key infrastructure implementation, set **Use well known CA certificate** to *No*, and then upload the certificate or use an existing certificate.
    1. Under **Host name override**, if you are using a *backend portal name* that is different from your *frontend portal name*, select *Override with specific domain name* and place in the domain name of your API gateway - the *backend portal name*.
    1. Leave **Use custom probe** as *No* - this setting will be changed in a later step.
    1. Select **Save** to save the configuration.

1. Create a listener for the API Gateway frontend:
    1. Navigate to **Listeners** and select **Add listener**.  **Add listener** page appears.
    1. Name the listener something appropriate, such as *APIM-GW-Listener*.
