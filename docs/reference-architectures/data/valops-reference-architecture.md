### Workflow

> Use a numbered list if there are corresponding numbers in the diagram. If not, use a bulleted list.

The following workflow (or dataflow) corresponds to the above diagram:

- **Thing 1**. Explain what happens with the first technology in the diagram.

- **Thing 2**. Explain what happens with the second technology in the diagram.

### Components

> A bulleted list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product service pages. This is for lead generation (what business, marketing, and PG want). It helps drive revenue.

> Why is each component there?
> What does it do and why was it necessary?
> Link the name of the service (via embedded link) to the service's product service page. Be sure to exclude the localization part of the URL (such as "en-US/").

- Examples: 
  - [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service)
  - [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service)
  - [Azure Cognitive Services Language Understanding](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service)
  - [Azure Cognitive Services Speech Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/speech-services)
  - [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database)
  - [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor): Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor.
  - [Resource Groups][resource-groups] is a logical container for Azure resources.  We use resource groups to organize everything related to this project in the Azure console.

### Alternatives

> Use this section to talk about alternative Azure services or architectures that you might consider for this solution. Include the reasons why you might choose these alternatives. Customers find this valuable because they want to know what other services or technologies they can use as part of this architecture.

> What alternative technologies were considered and why didn't we use them?

## Scenario details

> This should be an introduction of the business problem and why this scenario was built to solve it.
>   What industry is the customer in?
>   What prompted them to solve the problem?
>   What services were used in building out this solution?
>   What does this example scenario show? What are the customer's goals?

> What were the benefits of implementing the solution described below?

### Potential use cases

> Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

_Include considerations for deploying or configuring the elements of this architecture._

## Considerations

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce this section:

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

> Are there any lessons learned from running this that would be helpful for new customers?  What went wrong when building it out?  What went right?
> How do I need to think about managing, maintaining, and monitoring this long term?

> REQUIREMENTS: 
>   For a Reference Architecture, you must include all of these H3 sub-sections/WAF pillars: Reliability, Security, Cost optimization, Operational excellence, and Performance efficiency.

### Reliability

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

> This section includes resiliency and availability considerations. They can also be H4 headers in this section, if you think they should be separated.
> Are there any key resiliency and reliability considerations (past the typical)?

### Security

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

> This section includes identity and data sovereignty considerations.
> Are there any security considerations (past the typical) that I should know about this?
> Because security is important to our business, be sure to include your Azure security baseline assessment recommendations in this section. See https://aka.ms/AzureSecurityBaselines

### Cost optimization

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

> How much will this cost to run? See if you can answer this without dollar amounts.
> Are there ways I could save cost?
> If it scales linearly, than we should break it down by cost/unit. If it does not, why?
> What are the components that make up the cost?
> How does scale affect the cost?

> Link to the pricing calculator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) with all of the components in the architecture included, even if they're a $0 or $1 usage.
> If it makes sense, include small/medium/large configurations. Describe what needs to be changed as you move to larger sizes.

### Operational excellence

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

> This includes DevOps, monitoring, and diagnostics considerations.
> How do I need to think about operating this solution?

### Performance efficiency

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

> This includes scalability considerations.
> Are there any key performance considerations (past the typical)?
> Are there any size considerations around this specific solution? What scale does this work at? At what point do things break or not make sense for this architecture?

## Deploy this scenario

> REQUIRED: Reference Architectures require a deployment. If you cannot provide a deployment, use the Example Workload template instead. 

_Describe a step-by-step process for implementing the reference architecture solution. Best practices are to add the solution to GitHub, provide a link (use boilerplate text below), and explain how to roll out the solution._

A deployment for a reference architecture that implements these recommendations and considerations is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/path-to-repo).

## Contributors

> (Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not be mentioned.)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every section), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Principal authors" list and the "Other contributors" list, if there are additional contributors (all in plain text, not italics or bold). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). (The profiles can be linked to from the person's LinkedIn page, and we hope to automate that on the platform in the future). Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.*

Principal authors: > Only the primary authors. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 - [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

Other contributors: > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 - [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - > Continue for each additional contributor (even if there are 10 of them).

*To see non-public LinkedIn profiles, sign in to LinkedIn.*

## Next steps

> Link to Learn articles. Could also be to appropriate sources outside of Learn, such as GitHub repos, third-party documentation, or an official technical blog post.

Examples:
* [Azure Machine Learning documentation](/azure/machine-learning)
* [What are Azure Cognitive Services?](/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services)

## Related resources

> Use "Related resources" for architecture information that's relevant to the current article. It must be content that the Azure Architecture Center TOC refers to, but may be from a repo other than the AAC repo.
> Links to articles in the AAC repo should be repo-relative, for example (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
