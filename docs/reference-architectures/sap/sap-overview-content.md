The SAP on Azure Architecture Guide describes a set of guiding tenets that are used to help ensure the quality of SAP workloads running on Azure. This guide is based on the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](../../framework/index.md), but the recommendations are specific to deployments of SAP solutions. A solid architectural foundation starts with five pillars of excellence: cost, DevOps, resiliency, scalability, and security.

Microsoft and SAP work in [partnership](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/05/09/microsoft-partners-with-sap-as-the-first-global-cloud-provider-to-launch-project-embrace/) to provide a clear roadmap for organizations that want to innovate in the cloud. Azure supports SAP applications on Linux and Windows across development, test, and production environments. Our customers run SAP deployments of all sizes on Azure—including SAP NetWeaver an all supported Database Management Systems, SAP S/4HANA, BW/4HANA,  BI, and HANA in scale-up and scale-out scenarios. 

One way to get started is to run through the [Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review&mode=pre-assessment).

## Cost

When you move your workloads to the cloud, you have multiple aspects which can help to reduce costs of the overall solution. Many of them are covered in the Azure Well-Architected Framework under the [pillar of cost optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/). When you move SAP solutions to Azure, you have the additional opportunity to perform cost optimization. You can start a **rationalization** of your landscape or there is the chance to **rearchitecture** or substitute components, especially when moving from Business Suite to S/4HANA during your journey to the cloud. All these actions take place at the beginning of your journey to Azure and continues throughout.

System rationalization answers cost-related questions. For example, do you need to move all SAP systems, or can you decommission those which are no longer used? Is it more cost-efficient to refactor certain workloads—or more timely to lift and shift? Do you really need a system as large as you sized it on premises?

To see how Microsoft IT answered these questions, read about how the team decommissioned approximately 60 virtual machines as part of our own [SAP migration to Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/blog/hello-azure-unpacking-microsoft-moved-sap-workload-cloud/).

An efficient approach eliminates waste within your SAP deployment on Azure and helps lower costs and ease operations. For example, after your go-live in Azure, review the sizing. Based on utilization, can you reduce the size of the virtual machines for your landscapes? Can you detach disks that are no longer being used?

Bringing rationalization together with a potential rearchitecture of the overall business solution is also an appropriate way of reducing costs. There is the potential to move business process to SaaS services.

### Continuous cost management

Another way to reduce costs is to deallocate or “snooze” virtual machines. If you run your sandbox systems 10 hours a day, Monday through Friday, instead of around the clock every day, you might reduce your costs up to approximately 70 percent in a pay-as-you-go model. When your SAP applications need to run all the time, opt for [Azure Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/) to also help drive down costs.

Combining virtual machine [pricing options](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/sles-sap/)  can also lower costs. For budget predictability, you can use an Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instance, an advanced purchase for one or three years in a specified region. For low cost and flexibility, you can pay as you go for compute capacity, which requires no long term-commitment.

As a final note, it’s a good practice to review your Azure operations regularly and look for ways to optimize costs. For example, check to see whether a more cost-effective storage option is available or a newer VM series with a better price-to-performance ratio. For more details, see cost management discipline in the [govern methodology for cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/methodology) as part of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## DevOps

The DevOps pillar of the SAP on Azure Architecture Guide covers operational and efficiency considerations for deploying any SAP landscapes on Azure and for running SAP solutions in production.

### Automation

To reduce the chance of human error, improve reliability and achieve higher standardization, SAP deployments in Azure should be automated. Trying to set up the infrastructure manually for individual SAP deployments is not only tedious but also prone to error—and it can take hours or days if multiple SAP installations are required. So, for a predictable, efficient deployment process, it makes sense to automate your Azure infrastructure deployments and SAP software installations as much as possible.

Embracing a DevOps paradigm means using an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach to building new SAP environments as needed. IaC is a key consideration in SAP project landscapes.

|Manual deployment pains  | Automated deployment gains |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
|- Requires specialized knowledge in many domains outside of SAP |- Works immediately after some initial preparation time and requires little domain knowledge|
|- Can take a lot of time depending on the size of the SAP landscape, depending on the size of the SAP landscape |- Consumes predictable time from 30 minutes to a couple of hours|
|- Can be expensive |- Provides free resources—like these [SAP HANA templates](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana) on GitHub|
|- Limits testing—it's harder to inject tests in the process |- Provides templates that include test instrumentation during deployment and migration|
|- Makes it tedious and time-consuming to scale and customize the environment |- Makes it easy to scale up, down, and out, and new deployment templates are available|
|- Can lead to unwanted variations in design |- Once defined the standards are applied with each deployment

### Monitoring

Monitoring and diagnostics are crucial. SAP applications on Azure run in a remote Microsoft datacenter. You give up some control over the infrastructure and, in some cases, the operating system, in exchange for the benefits of cloud services.

For a large application, it's not practical to connect to virtual machines to troubleshoot an issue or sift through log files. In addition, when you use platform as a service (PaaS) on Azure, there may not even be a dedicated virtual machine.

All systems must be observable. Monitoring and diagnostics give insight into a system so that you know when and where failures occur. A best practice is to use a common and consistent logging schema that lets you correlate events across systems.

The monitoring and diagnostics process has several distinct phases:

- **Instrumentation.** Generating the raw data from application logs, web server logs, the diagnostics built into the Azure platform, and other sources

- **Collection and storage.** Consolidating the data into one place

- **Analysis and diagnosis.** Troubleshooting issues and seeing the overall health

- **Visualization and alerts.** Using telemetry data to spot trends or alert your operations team

## Resiliency

The resiliency pillar of the SAP on Azure Architecture Guide refers to the operational stability and business continuity you need to run mission-critical, tier-1 SAP applications. Designing for availability ensures SAP application uptime in the event of localized software or hardware failures.

In production environments, it’s important to guard against a single point of failure for each application and infrastructure component. This can be achieved by the principles of isolation and redundancy.

- **Isolation.** Ensure that all components involved are isolated on an application and infrastructure layer.

- **Redundancy.** Ensure that all components involved are redundantly available on an application and infrastructure layer.

Keeping these basic principles in mind, the recommendation would be to implement 3-tier systems across the SAP landscapes, ensuring that all application components involved are isolated from each other and can achieve high-availability through redundancy.

We recommend deploying the virtual machines that run SAP Central Services and databases in Availability Sets or Availability Zones, which help protect applications against planned maintenance events and unplanned outages.  

When applying resiliency to the SAP application servers, we recommend using fewer, smaller servers instead of one larger application server. The practice is to configure the guest operating system’s cluster technologies, such as Windows Failover Cluster or Linux Pacemaker, to help ensure short failover times of the SAP Central Services and database management system (DBMS). To ensure there is no (or minimal) data loss, the best practice is to configure DBMS synchronous or asynchronous replication depending on the scenario.

### Application server resiliency

Resiliency for the SAP application server layer can be achieved through redundancy.  You can configure multiple dialog instances on different instances of Azure virtual machines, with a minimum of two application servers.

We recommend deploying the Azure virtual machines that run the SAP application servers in the same [Azure Availability Set](/azure/virtual-machines/availability#availability-sets).  By placing the SAP application servers inside the same Azure Availability Set, this will ensure the following:

- The Azure virtual machines will not be a part of the same update domain, avoiding simultaneous downtime.

- The Azure virtual machines will not be a part of the same fault domain, avoiding shared physical layers between the Azure virtual machines.

From a disaster recovery perspective, [Azure-to-Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sap) can be used as part of an efficient, cost-conscious disaster recovery solution.

For more information, see [High-availability architecture for SAP application servers](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios#high-availability-architecture-for-sap-application-servers).

### Central services resiliency

The SAP central services layer, consisting out of (A)SCS/ERS (Linux only), are considered as a single point of failure (SPOF) of which the components must be set up high-available to achieve resiliency.  The solution consists out of creating a cluster of the SAP central services layer, supported by a compatible shared storage technology.

Depending on the operating system and available shared storage technology in General Availability (GA) or Private/Public Preview, various options are available.

For more information, see [High-availability architecture for an SAP ASCS/SCS instance on Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios#high-availability-architecture-for-an-sap-ascsscs-instance-on-windows) and [High-availability architecture for an SAP ASCS/SCS instance on Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios#high-availability-architecture-for-an-sap-ascsscs-instance-on-linux).

### Database resiliency

On the database layer, production data can be replicated within the region or between primary and disaster recovery region (Synchronous in case of high availability or Asynchronous in case of DR replication).  Depending on the choice of DBMS and required business SLA’s, different database methods can be utilized.

When designing a resilient architecture for the database layer, consider the following aspects:

- **Resiliency against data loss.** Designing for resiliency means recovering from data loss. That might mean recovering from a logical error on the SAP database, a large-scale disaster, or the loss of a complete Azure region. When designing for recoverability, it is necessary to understand the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of your SAP application.
It is essential to carefully consider both availability and recoverability within the design of the SAP deployment architecture. This will protect your business from financial losses resulting in downtime and data loss.

- **Use of synchronous replication.** When there is a business need of RPO = 0, meaning no data loss in case of a failure, we need to consider synchronous replication on the database layer and design accordingly.  This results in a system where every transaction needs to be committed on at least both sides of the highly available databases.
Latency between the two DBMS instances needs to be measured and considered carefully.  The higher the network latency, the more likely it will affect the scalability of your workload.
This is especially important when deciding to use [Availability Zones](/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) where workloads can be separated in an Azure region in unique physical locations.  As the physical distance between these locations, so will the network latency.

For more information, see [General Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/dbms_guide_general) and its listed recommendations per DBMS. 

### Backup resiliency

In addition to a resilient architecture, including high-availability and disaster-recovery capabilities, mission critical environments need to implement a backup solution as well.

SAP HANA specifically offers a backup API called Backint, allowing backup solutions to backup directly on the database layer.

Several certified third-party backup solutions exist in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/), offering vendor- and SAP-certified backup capabilities.

Storage solutions such as Azure NetApp Files can backup critical data through the capabilities of snapshots.

Azure Backup is Azure’s native backup solution: 

- Native SAP HANA backups through the Backint connector.
- Ability to create an application consistent backup using disks snapshots of Azure Premium storage.
- Backup and restore of Azure VM data through the Azure portal.  Cross-region restore provides the possibility to restore Azure VMs to a paired secondary region.
- Long-term retention, allowing to retain backups years for compliance and audit needs.
- Backup Management from the Azure portal.

For more information on SAP HANA backup capabilities, see [SAP HANA backup overview](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-hana-backup-guide).

For more information on Azure Backup, see [Azure Backup service documentation](/azure/backup).

## Scalability

The scalability pillar of the SAP on Azure Architecture Guide describes performance efficiency and meeting the demands placed on a workload. Users also need high-performing SAP applications so they can work efficiently without frustration. It’s important to undertake a quality sizing exercise for your SAP deployment and to right-size your Azure components—compute, storage, and network.

[SAP Note \#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533) details the [SAPS](https://www.sap.com/about/benchmark/measuring.html) value for the virtual machines that are supported to run SAP applications. (To access this SAP note, an SAP Service Marketplace account is required.) For more information about the network and storage throughput per Azure virtual machine type, see these resources:

- [Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-n...)

- [Sizes for Linux virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-net...)

The agility of Azure allows you to scale your SAP system with ease. For example, you can increase the compute capacity of the database server or scale horizontally by adding application servers when demand arises. You can also temporarily bulk up your infrastructure to accelerate your SAP migration throughput and reduce the downtime.

Consider the use of SAP redundancy features such as logon groups and batch server groups to assign application servers to.  Per group definition, SAP can dispatch automatically the workload to multiple application server instances, giving your system the capability to (automatically) scale-out or scale-in when demand increases or decreases.

For the SAP database layer, use Premium Azure Managed Disks as a minimum to benefit from high-performance and low-latency I/O. You may need to build a RAID-0 stripe to aggregate IOPS and throughput to meet your application needs. For details about storage best practices for SAP HANA workloads, see [SAP HANA infrastructure configurations and operations on Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations).

We recommend using an [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) circuit or a virtual private network (VPN) between on-premises resources and Azure. These connections benefit SAP users and the application interfaces that connect to your SAP applications on Azure. For production SAP applications in Azure, we recommend ExpressRoute to create a private, dedicated connection that offers reliability, faster speed, lower latency, and tighter security than site-to-site VPN.

Be mindful of latency-sensitive interfaces between SAP and non-SAP applications. You may need to define *migration move groups*—that is, groups of SAP and non-SAP applications that land on Azure together.

## Security

Your SAP data is likely the treasure of your organization's technical footprint. Therefore, you need to focus on securing access to your SAP architecture by way of secure authentication, protecting your application and data from network vulnerabilities, and maintaining data integrity through encryption methods.

SAP on Azure is delivered in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud model. This means security protections are built into the service by Microsoft at the level of the physical datacenter, physical network, physical host, and hypervisor. For the areas above the hypervisor—such as the guest operating system for SAP—you need to carefully evaluate the services and technologies you select to ensure you are providing the proper security controls for your architecture.

For authentication, you can take advantage of [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/) (Azure AD) with SAML to sign on to your SAP [NetWeaver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-netweaver-tutorial) or [HANA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/saphana-tutorial), also use SSO for other SAP services like [Fiori Launchpad](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-fiori-tutorial), [SAP Cloud Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-hana-cloud-platform-tutorial), or [SuccessFactors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/successfactors-tutorial) can be configured. 

[Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) (NSGs) allow you to filter network traffic to and from resources in your
[virtual network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview). You can define NSG rules to allow or deny access to your SAP services—for
instance, allowing access to the SAP application ports from on-premises IP addresses ranges and denying public internet access.

[Application security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/application-security-groups) (ASG) should be used to make it easier to configure the network security. The ASG can be used in security rules instead of explicit IPs for VMs. And the VMs are then assigned to ASG. This will support the reuse of the same policy over different application landscapes, because of this abstraction layer. 

Regarding data integrity, [Azure Disk Encryption](/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption-faq) helps you encrypt your SAP virtual machine disks. Both the operating system and data volumes can be encrypted at rest in storage.

Azure Disk Encryption works with [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis), a service that controls and manages your encryption keys. Azure Key Vault supports the SQL server from DBMS point of view. Many of our SAP customers choose Azure Disk Encryption for their operating system disks and transparent DBMS data encryption for their SAP database files. This approach promotes the integrity of the operating system and helps ensure that database backups are also encrypted.

### Identity management

Consider using Azure AD to authenticate and authorize users. Azure AD is a fully managed identity and access management service. You can use it to create domains that exist purely on Azure or to integrate with your on-premises Active Directory identities. Azure AD also integrates with Microsoft 365, Dynamics CRM Online, and many software as a service (SaaS) applications from partners.

For consumer-facing applications, Azure Active Directory B2C lets users authenticate with their existing social accounts (such as Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn) or to create a new user account that is managed by Azure AD.

If you want to integrate an on-premises Active Directory environment with an Azure network, several approaches are possible, depending on your requirements. For more information, see the [identity management](../identity/index.yml) reference architectures.

### Protecting your infrastructure

Control access to the Azure resources that you deploy. Every Azure subscription has a [trust relationship](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory) with an Azure AD tenant. Use [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to grant users within your organization the correct permissions to Azure resources. Grant access by assigning Azure roles to users or groups at a certain scope. The scope can be a subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. Make sure to [audit](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-audit) all changes to infrastructure.

### Application security

In general, the security best practices for application development also apply in the cloud. These include things like using Secure Sockets Layers (SSLs) everywhere, protecting against cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and preventing SQL injection attacks.

Cloud applications often use managed services that have access keys. It bears repeating: never check these into source control. Instead, consider storing application secrets in Azure Key Vault.

### Data sovereignty and encryption

Make sure that your data remains in the correct geopolitical zone when using highly available regions in Azure. Azure Storage, like [Azure NetApp Files](/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction), can provide geo-replication based on the concept of a [paired region](/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) in the same geopolitical zone. 

A common feature of cloud-based infrastructures like Azure Storage is that they provide a highly available and durable platform for hosting data and applications. Developers of cloud-based applications must consider carefully how to leverage this platform to maximize those advantages for their users. 

When deciding which redundancy option is best for your scenario, consider the tradeoffs between lower costs and higher availability. In case, customers would like to replicate their SAP on Azure infrastructure to other Azure regions for Business continuity and Disaster recovery purpose, they can achieve the same with Storage replication, for example GRS or Disaster Recovery mechanisms like Azure Site Recovery. More details at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy  

We recommend using Key Vault to safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets. You can use Key Vault to encrypt keys and small secrets, like passwords, that use keys stored in hardware security modules (HSMs).  Azure Key Vault supports the SQL server from DBMS point of view. Many storage and database services support data encryption at rest, including [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption), [Azure SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault), [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is), and [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/database-security).

## Infrastructure

A quality SAP deployment starts with careful planning. The [SAP workloads on Azure: planning and deployment checklist](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-deployment-checklist) points you in the right direction, with checklists, milestones, and best practices.

If you are moving an existing SAP estate to Azure, the [Migration Methodologies for SAP on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/migration-methodologies-for-sap-on-azure/) white paper describes migration options. If your SAP application has a significant database footprint, refer to the [Very Large Database Migration to Azure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Running-SAP-Applications-on-the/Very-Large-Database-Migration-to-Azure-8211-Recommendations/ba-p/368146) blog post.

The following scenarios outline a few of the common ways SAP solutions are built on an Azure infrastructure.
