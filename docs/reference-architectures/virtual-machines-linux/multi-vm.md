# Run load-balanced VMs for scalability and availability

This reference architecture shows a set of proven practices for running multiple Linux virtual machines (VMs) in a scale set behind a load balancer, to improve availability and scalability. This architecture can be used for any stateless workload, such as a web server, and is a foundation for deploying n-tier applications. [**Deploy this solution**.](#deploy-the-solution)

## Architecture

This architecture builds on the [Single VM reference architecture][single-vm]. Those recommendations also apply to this architecture.

In this architecture, a workload is distributed across multiple VM instances. There is a single public IP address, and Internet traffic is distributed to the VMs using a load balancer. This architecture can be used for a single-tier application, such as a stateless web application.

The architecture has the following components:

* **Resource group.** [Resource groups][resource-manager-overview] are used to group resources so they can be managed by lifetime, owner, or other criteria.
* **Virtual network (VNet) and subnet.** Every Azure VM is deployed into a VNet that can be segmented into multiple subnets.
* **Azure Load Balancer**. The [load balancer][load-balancer] distributes incoming Internet requests to the VM instances. 
* **Public IP address**. A public IP address is needed for the load balancer to receive Internet traffic.
* **Azure DNS**. [Azure DNS][azure-dns] is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
* **VM scale set**. A [VM scale set][vm-scaleset] is a set of identical VMs used to host a workload. Scale sets allow the number of VMs to be scaled in or out manually, or automatically based on predefined rules.
* **Availability set**. The [availability set][availability-set] contains the VMs, making the VMs eligible for a higher [service level agreement (SLA)][vm-sla]. For the higher SLA to apply, the availability set must include a minimum of two VMs. Availability sets are implicit in scale sets. If you create VMs outside a scale set, you need to create the availability set independently.
* **Managed disks**. Azure Managed Disks manage the virtual hard disk (VHD) files for the VM disks. 
* **Storage**. Create an Azure Storage acount to hold diagnostic logs for the VMs.

## Recommendations

Your requirements may not align completely with the architecture described here. Use these recommendations as a starting point. 

### Availability and scalability recommendations

An option for availability and scalability is to use a [virtual machine scale set][vmss]. VM scale sets help you to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. Scale sets support autoscaling based on performance metrics. As the load on the VMs increases, additional VMs are automatically added to the load balancer. Consider scale sets if you need to quickly scale out VMs, or need to autoscale.

By default, scale sets use "overprovisioning," which means the scale set initially provisions more VMs than you ask for, then deletes the extra VMs. This improves the overall success rate when provisioning the VMs. If you are not using [managed disks](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-managed-disks), we recommend no more than 20 VMs per storage account with overprovisioning enabled, and no more than 40 VMs with overprovisioning disabled.

There are two basic ways to configure VMs deployed in a scale set:

- Use extensions to configure the VM after it is provisioned. With this approach, new VM instances may take longer to start up than a VM with no extensions.

- Deploy a [managed disk](/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview) with a custom disk image. This option may be quicker to deploy. However, it requires you to keep the image up to date.

For additional considerations, see [Design considerations for scale sets][vmss-design].

> [!TIP]
> When using any autoscale solution, test it with production-level workloads well in advance.

If you do not use a scale set, consider at least using an availability set. Create at least two VMs in the availability set to support the [availability SLA for Azure VMs][vm-sla]. The Azure load balancer also requires that load-balanced VMs belong to the same availability set.

Each Azure subscription has default limits in place, including a maximum number of VMs per region. You can increase the limit by filing a support request. For more information, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints][subscription-limits].

### Network recommendations

Deploy the VMs within the same subnet. Do not expose the VMs directly to the Internet, but instead give each VM a private IP address. Clients connect using the public IP address of the load balancer.

If you need to log into the VMs behind the load balancer, consider adding a single VM as a jumpbox (also called a bastion host) with a public IP address you can log into. And then log into the VMs behind the load balancer from the jumpbox. Alternatively, you can configure the load balancer's inbound network address translation (NAT) rules. However, having a jumpbox is a better solution when you are hosting n-tier workloads or multiple workloads.

### Load balancer recommendations

Add all VMs in the availability set to the back-end address pool of the load balancer.

Define load balancer rules to direct network traffic to the VMs. For example, to enable HTTP traffic, create a rule that maps port 80 from the front-end configuration to port 80 on the back-end address pool. When a client sends an HTTP request to port 80, the load balancer selects a back-end IP address by using a [hashing algorithm][load-balancer-hashing] that includes the source IP address. In that way, client requests are distributed across all the VMs.

To route traffic to a specific VM, use NAT rules. For example, to enable RDP to the VMs, create a separate NAT rule for each VM. Each rule should map a distinct port number to port 3389, the default port for RDP. For example, use port 50001 for "VM1," port 50002 for "VM2," and so on. Assign the NAT rules to the NICs on the VMs.

### Storage account recommendations

We recommend the use of [managed disks](/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview) with [premium storage][premium]. Managed disks do not require a storage account. You simply specify the size and type of disk and it is deployed as a highly available resource.

If you are using unmanaged disks, create separate Azure storage accounts for each VM to hold the virtual hard disks (VHDs), in order to avoid hitting the input/output operations per second [(IOPS) limits][vm-disk-limits] for storage accounts.

Create one storage account for diagnostic logs. This storage account can be shared by all the VMs. This can be an unmanaged storage account using standard disks.

## Availability considerations

The availability set makes your application more resilient to both planned and unplanned maintenance events.

* *Planned maintenance* occurs when Microsoft updates the underlying platform, sometimes causing VMs to be restarted. Azure makes sure the VMs in an availability set are not all restarted at the same time. At least one is kept running while others are restarting.
* *Unplanned maintenance* happens if there is a hardware failure. Azure makes sure that VMs in an availability set are provisioned across more than one server rack. This helps to reduce the impact of hardware failures, network outages, power interruptions, and so on.

For more information, see [Manage the availability of virtual machines][availability-set]. The following video also provides a good overview of availability sets: [How Do I Configure an Availability Set to Scale VMs][availability-set-ch9].

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to configure the availability set when you provision the VM. Currently, there is no way to add a Resource Manager VM to an availability set after the VM is provisioned.

The load balancer uses [health probes][health-probes] to monitor the availability of VM instances. If a probe cannot reach an instance within a timeout period, the load balancer stops sending traffic to that VM. However, the load balancer will continue to probe, and if the VM becomes available again, the load balancer resumes sending traffic to that VM.

Here are some recommendations on load balancer health probes:

* Probes can test either HTTP or TCP. If your VMs run an HTTP server, create an HTTP probe. Otherwise create a TCP probe.
* For an HTTP probe, specify the path to an HTTP endpoint. The probe checks for an HTTP 200 response from this path. This can be the root path ("/"), or a health-monitoring endpoint that implements some custom logic to check the health of the application. The endpoint must allow anonymous HTTP requests.
* The probe is sent from a [known IP address][health-probe-ip], 168.63.129.16. Make sure you don't block traffic to or from this IP address in any firewall policies or network security group (NSG) rules.
* Use [health probe logs][health-probe-log] to view the status of the health probes. Enable logging in the Azure portal for each load balancer. Logs are written to Azure Blob storage. The logs show how many VMs on the back end are not receiving network traffic due to failed probe responses.

## Manageability considerations

With multiple VMs, it is important to automate processes so they are reliable and repeatable. You can use [Azure Automation][azure-automation] to automate deployment, OS patching, and other tasks.

## Security considerations

Virtual networks are a traffic isolation boundary in Azure. VMs in one VNet cannot communicate directly with VMs in a different VNet. VMs within the same VNet can communicate, unless you create [network security groups][nsg] (NSGs) to restrict traffic. For more information, see [Microsoft cloud services and network security][network-security].

For incoming Internet traffic, the load balancer rules define which traffic can reach the back end. However, load balancer rules don't support IP safe lists, so if you want to add certain public IP addresses to a safe list, add an NSG to the subnet.

## Deploy the solution

A deployment for this architecture is available on [GitHub][github-folder]. It deploys the following:

  * A virtual network with a single subnet named **web** that contains the VMs.
  * A VM scale set that contains VMs running the latest version of Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. Autoscale is enabled.
  * A load balancer that sits in front of the VM scale set.
  * An NSG with incoming rules that allow HTTP traffic to the VM scale set.
