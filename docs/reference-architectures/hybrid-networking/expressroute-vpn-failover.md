# Connect an on-premises network to Azure using ExpressRoute with VPN failover

This reference architecture shows how to connect an on-premises network to an Azure virtual network (VNet) using ExpressRoute, with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) as a failover connection. Traffic flows between the on-premises network and the Azure VNet through an ExpressRoute connection. If there is a loss of connectivity in the ExpressRoute circuit, traffic is routed through an IPSec VPN tunnel. [**Deploy this solution**](#deploy-the-solution).

Note that if the ExpressRoute circuit is unavailable, the VPN route will only handle private peering connections. Public peering and Microsoft peering connections will pass over the Internet.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components.

- **On-premises network**. A private local-area network running within an organization.

- **VPN appliance**. A device or service that provides external connectivity to the on-premises network. The VPN appliance may be a hardware device, or it can be a software solution such as the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) in Windows Server 2012. For a list of supported VPN appliances and information on configuring selected VPN appliances for connecting to Azure, see [About VPN devices for Site-to-Site VPN Gateway connections][vpn-appliance].

- **ExpressRoute circuit**. A layer 2 or layer 3 circuit supplied by the connectivity provider that joins the on-premises network with Azure through the edge routers. The circuit uses the hardware infrastructure managed by the connectivity provider.

- **ExpressRoute virtual network gateway**. The ExpressRoute virtual network gateway enables the VNet to connect to the ExpressRoute circuit used for connectivity with your on-premises network.

- **VPN virtual network gateway**. The VPN virtual network gateway enables the VNet to connect to the VPN appliance in the on-premises network. The VPN virtual network gateway is configured to accept requests from the on-premises network only through the VPN appliance. For more information, see [Connect an on-premises network to a Microsoft Azure virtual network][connect-to-an-Azure-vnet].

- **VPN connection**. The connection has properties that specify the connection type (IPSec) and the key shared with the on-premises VPN appliance to encrypt traffic.

- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**. Each VNet resides in a single Azure region, and can host multiple application tiers. Application tiers can be segmented using subnets in each VNet.

- **Gateway subnet**. The virtual network gateways are held in the same subnet.

- **Cloud application**. The application hosted in Azure. It might include multiple tiers, with multiple subnets connected through Azure load balancers. For more information about the application infrastructure, see [Running Windows VM workloads][windows-vm-ra] and [Running Linux VM workloads][linux-vm-ra].

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

### VNet and GatewaySubnet

Create the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway and the VPN virtual network gateway in the same VNet. This means that they should share the same subnet named *GatewaySubnet*.

If the VNet already includes a subnet named *GatewaySubnet*, ensure that it has a /27 or larger address space. If the existing subnet is too small, use the following PowerShell command to remove the subnet:

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name <yourvnetname> -ResourceGroupName <yourresourcegroup>
Remove-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name GatewaySubnet -VirtualNetwork $vnet
```

If the VNet does not contain a subnet named **GatewaySubnet**, create a new one using the following Powershell command:

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name <yourvnetname> -ResourceGroupName <yourresourcegroup>
Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "GatewaySubnet" -VirtualNetwork $vnet -AddressPrefix "10.200.255.224/27"
$vnet = Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
```

### VPN and ExpressRoute gateways

Verify that your organization meets the [ExpressRoute prerequisite requirements][expressroute-prereq] for connecting to Azure.

If you already have a VPN virtual network gateway in your Azure VNet, use the following  Powershell command to remove it:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name <yourgatewayname> -ResourceGroupName <yourresourcegroup>
```

Follow the instructions in [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][implementing-expressroute] to establish your ExpressRoute connection.

Follow the instructions in [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][implementing-vpn] to establish your VPN virtual network gateway connection.

After you have established the virtual network gateway connections, test the environment as follows:

1. Make sure you can connect from your on-premises network to your Azure VNet.
2. Contact your provider to stop ExpressRoute connectivity for testing.
3. Verify that you can still connect from your on-premises network to your Azure VNet using the VPN virtual network gateway connection.
4. Contact your provider to reestablish ExpressRoute connectivity.

## Considerations

For ExpressRoute considerations, see the [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute] guidance.

For site-to-site VPN considerations, see the [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn] guidance.

For general Azure security considerations, see [Microsoft cloud services and network security][best-practices-security].

## Deploy the solution

**Prerequisites**. You must have an existing on-premises infrastructure already configured with a suitable network appliance.

To deploy the solution, perform the following steps.

1. Click the button below:<br><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmspnp%2Freference-architectures%2Fmaster%2Fhybrid-networking%2Fexpressroute-vpn-failover%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

2. Wait for the link to open in the Azure portal, then follow these steps:
   - The **Resource group** name is already defined in the parameter file, so select **Create New** and enter `ra-hybrid-vpn-er-rg` in the text box.
   - Select the region from the **Location** drop down box.
   - Do not edit the **Template Root Uri** or the **Parameter Root Uri** text boxes.
   - Review the terms and conditions, then click the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.
   - Click the **Purchase** button.

3. Wait for the deployment to complete.
