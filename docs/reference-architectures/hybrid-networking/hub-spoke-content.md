This reference architecture details a hub-spoke topology in Azure. The hub virtual network acts as a central point of connectivity to many spoke virtual networks. The hub can also be used as the connectivity point to your on-premises networks. The spoke virtual networks peer with the hub and can be used to isolate workloads.

The benefits of using a hub and spoke configuration include cost savings, overcoming subscription limits, and workload isolation.

## Use cases

Typical uses for this architecture include:

- Workloads deployed in different environments, such as development, testing, and production, that require shared services such as DNS, IDS, NTP, or AD DS. Shared services are placed in the hub virtual network, while each environment is deployed to a spoke to maintain isolation.
- Workloads that do not require connectivity to each other but require access to shared services.
- Enterprises that require central control over security aspects, such as a firewall in the hub as a DMZ, and segregated management for the workloads in each spoke.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components.

**Hub virtual network:** The hub virtual network is the central point of connectivity to your on-premises network and a place to host services that can be consumed by the different workloads hosted in the spoke virtual networks.

**Spoke virtual networks:** Spoke virtual networks are used to isolate workloads in their own virtual networks, managed separately from other spokes. Each workload might include multiple tiers, with multiple subnets connected through Azure load balancers.

**Virtual network peering:** Two virtual networks can be connected using a [peering connection](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview). Peering connections are non-transitive, low latency connections between virtual networks. Once peered, the virtual networks exchange traffic by using the Azure backbone without the need for a router.

**Bastion Host:** Azure Bastion lets you securely connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. An Azure Bastion host is deployed inside an Azure Virtual Network and can access virtual machines in the VNet, or virtual machines in peered VNets.

**Azure Firewall:** Azure Firewall is a managed firewall as a service. The Firewall instance is placed in its own subnet.

**VPN virtual network gateway or ExpressRoute gateway**. The virtual network gateway enables the virtual network to connect to the VPN device, or ExpressRoute circuit, used for connectivity with your on-premises network. For more information, see [Connect an on-premises network to a Microsoft Azure virtual network](/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-an-on-premises-network-to-a-microsoft-azure-virtual-network?view=o365-worldwide).

**VPN device**. A device or service that provides external connectivity to the on-premises network. The VPN device may be a hardware device or a software solution such as the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) in Windows Server 2012. For more information, see [About VPN devices for Site-to-Site VPN Gateway connections](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices).

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply to most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

### Resource groups

The sample solution included in this document uses a single Azure resource group. In practice, the hub and each spoke can be implemented in different resource groups and even different subscriptions. When you peer virtual networks in different subscriptions, both subscriptions can be associated with the same or different Azure Active Directory tenant. This allows for decentralized management of each workload while sharing services maintained in the hub.

### Virtual network and GatewaySubnet

Create a subnet named *GatewaySubnet*, with an address range of /27. The virtual network gateway requires this subnet. Allocating 32 addresses to this subnet will help to prevent reaching gateway size limitations in the future.

For more information about setting up the gateway, see the following reference architectures, depending on your connection type:

- [Hybrid network using ExpressRoute](./expressroute.yml)
- [Hybrid network using a VPN gateway](./vpn.yml)

For higher availability, you can use ExpressRoute plus a VPN for failover. See [Connect an on-premises network to Azure using ExpressRoute with VPN failover](./expressroute-vpn-failover.yml).

A hub-spoke topology can also be used without a gateway if you don't need connectivity with your on-premises network.

### Virtual network peering

Virtual network peering is a non-transitive relationship between two virtual networks. If you require spokes to connect to each other, consider adding a separate peering connection between those spokes.

However, suppose you have several spokes that need to connect with each other. In that case, you will run out of possible peering connections very quickly due to the limitation on the number of virtual network peerings per virtual network. (For more information, see [Networking limits](/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#networking-limits). In this scenario, consider using user-defined routes (UDRs) to force traffic destined to a spoke to be sent to Azure Firewall or a network virtual appliance acting as a router at the hub. This will allow the spokes to connect to each other.

You can also configure spokes to use the hub gateway to communicate with remote networks. To allow gateway traffic to flow from spoke to hub and connect to remote networks, you must:

- Configure the peering connection in the hub to **allow gateway transit**.
- Configure the peering connection in each spoke to **use remote gateways**.
- Configure all peering connections to **allow forwarded traffic**.

For additional information on creating virtual network peering, see [Create VNet peerings](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-peering#create-a-peering).

### Spoke connectivity

If you require connectivity between spokes, consider deploying an Azure Firewall or other network virtual appliance and create routes to forward traffic from the spoke to the firewall / network virtual appliance, which can then route to the second spoke. In this scenario, you must configure the peering connections to **allow forwarded traffic**.

![Routing between spokes using Azure Firewall](./images/spoke-spoke-routing.png)

You can also use a VPN gateway to route traffic between spokes, although this will impact latency and throughput. See [Configure VPN gateway transit for virtual network peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit) for configuration details.

Consider what services are shared in the hub to ensure the hub scales for a larger number of spokes. For instance, if your hub provides firewall services, consider your firewall solution's bandwidth limits when adding multiple spokes. You might want to move some of these shared services to a second level of hubs.

## Operational considerations

Consider the following when deploying and managing hub and spoke networks.

### Network monitoring

Use Azure Network Watcher to monitor and troubleshoot the network components, tools like Traffic Analytics will show you the systems in your virtual networks that generate the most traffic so that you can visually identify bottlenecks before they degenerate into problems. Network Performance Manager is the right tool to monitor information about Microsoft ExpressRoute circuits. VPN diagnostics is another tool that can help troubleshoot site-to-site VPN connections connecting your applications to users on-premises.

For more information, see [Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

## Cost considerations

Consider the following cost-related items when deploying and managing hub and spoke networks.

### Azure Firewall

In this architecture, an Azure Firewall is deployed in the hub network. When used as a shared solution and consumed by multiple workloads, an Azure Firewall can save up to 30-50% over other network virtual appliance. For more information, see [Azure Firewall vs network virtual appliance](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-firewall-and-network-virtual-appliances).

### Virtual network peering

You can use virtual network peering to route traffic between virtual networks by using private IP addresses. Here are some points:

- Ingress and egress traffic is charged at both ends of the peered networks. 
- Different zones have different transfer rates.

For instance, data transfer from a virtual network in zone 1 to another virtual network in zone 2, will incur outbound transfer rate for zone 1 and inbound rate for zone 2. For more information, see [Virtual network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network).
