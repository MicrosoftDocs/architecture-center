### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the previous diagram:

Mainframe and midrange systems update on-premises application databases at regular intervals. To maintain consistency, this solution syncs the latest data with Azure databases. The sync process involves the following steps.

1. Azure Data Factory dynamic pipelines orchestrate activities that range from data extraction to data loading. You can schedule pipeline activities, start them manually, or trigger them automatically.

   Pipelines group the activities that perform tasks. To extract data, Azure Data Factory dynamically creates one pipeline for each on-premises table. You can then use a massively parallel implementation when you replicate data in Azure. You can also configure the solution to meet your requirements: 

   - **Full replication:** You replicate the entire database and make the necessary modifications to data types and fields in the target Azure database.

   - **Partial, delta, or incremental replication:** You use watermark columns in source tables to sync the updated rows with Azure databases. These columns contain either a continuously incrementing key or a time stamp that indicates the table's last update.

    Azure Data Factory also uses pipelines for the following transformation tasks:

    - Data-type conversion
    - Data manipulation
    - Data formatting
    - Column derivation
    - Data flattening
    - Data sorting
    - Data filtering 

1. On-premises databases like Db2 zOS, Db2 for i, and Db2 LUW store the application data.
1. A self-hosted integration runtime (IR) provides the environment that Azure Data Factory uses to run and dispatch activities.
1. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Blob Storage stage the data. This step is sometimes required to transform and merge data from multiple sources.
1. For data preparation, Azure Data Factory uses Azure Databricks, custom activities, and pipeline dataflows to transform data quickly and effectively.
1. Azure Data Factory loads data into the following relational and nonrelational Azure databases:

   - Azure SQL
   - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
   - Azure Cosmos DB
   - Azure Data Lake Storage
   - Azure Database for MySQL 

1. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) extracts, transforms, and loads data.
1. The on-premises data gateway is a locally installed Windows client application that acts as a bridge between your local on-premises data sources and Azure services.
1. A data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric is a logical grouping of activities that perform data ingestion from Db2 to Azure storage and databases.
1. If the solution requires near real-time replication, you can use non-Microsoft tools.

## Scenario details

Data availability and integrity are essential in mainframe and midrange modernization. [Data-first strategies](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/mainframe/modernize-mainframe-data-to-azure) help keep data intact and available during the migration to Azure. To prevent disruptions during modernization, sometimes you need to replicate data quickly or keep on-premises data in sync with Azure databases.

Specifically, this solution covers:

- Extraction: Connect to and extract data from a source database.

- Transformation:

  - Staging: Temporarily store data in its original format and prepare it for transformation.

  - Preparation: Transform and manipulate data by using mapping rules that meet target database requirements.

- Loading: Insert data into a target database.

### Potential use cases

Data replication and sync scenarios that can benefit from this solution include:

- Command Query Responsibility Segregation architectures that use Azure to service all inquire channels.

- Environments that test on-premises applications and rehosted or re-engineered applications in parallel.

- On-premises systems that have tightly coupled applications that require phased remediation or modernization.

## Recommendations

You can apply the following recommendations to most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

When you use Azure Data Factory to extract data, take steps to [tune the performance of the copy activity](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-performance#performance-tuning-steps).
