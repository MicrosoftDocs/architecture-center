Data availability and integrity play an important role in mainframe and midrange modernization. [Data-first strategies][Modernize mainframe & midrange data] help to keep data intact and available during migration to Azure. To avoid impacting applications during modernization, sometimes you need to replicate data quickly or keep on-premises data in sync with Azure databases.

This reference architecture outlines an implementation plan for replicating and syncing data during modernization to Azure. It discusses technical aspects like data stores, tools, and services. Specifically, the solution covers:

- Extraction: Connecting to and extracting from a source database.
- Transformation:
  - Staging: Temporarily storing data in its original format and preparing it for transformation.
  - Preparation: Transforming and manipulating data by using mapping rules that meet target database requirements.
- Loading: Inserting data into a target database.

## Potential use cases

Data replication and sync scenarios that can benefit from this solution include:

- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architectures that use Azure to service all inquire channels.
- Environments that test on-premises applications and rehosted or re-engineered applications in parallel.
- On-premises systems with tightly coupled applications that require phased remediation or modernization.

## Architecture

:::image type="complex" source="./images/sync-mainframe-data-with-azure.png" alt-text="Architecture diagram showing how to sync on-premises and Azure databases during mainframe modernization." border="false":::
   The diagram contains two parts, one for on-premises components, and one for Azure components. The on-premises part contains rectangles, one that pictures databases and one that contains integration tools. A server icon that represents the self-hosted integration runtime is also located in the on-premises part. The Azure part also contains rectangles. One is for pipelines. Others are for services that the solution uses for staging and preparing data. Another contains Azure databases. Arrows point from on-premises components to Azure components. These arrows represent the flow of data in the replication and sync processes. One of the arrows goes through the on-premises data gateway.
:::image-end:::

Mainframe and midrange systems update on-premises application databases on a regular interval. To maintain consistency, the solution syncs the latest data with Azure databases. The sync process involves the following steps:

1. These actions occur throughout the process:

   1. An on-premises data gateway transfers data quickly and securely between on-premises systems and Azure services. With this configuration, the on-premises data gateway can receive instructions from Azure and replicate data without the on-premises network directly exposing the local data assets.
   1. Azure Data Factory pipelines orchestrate activities that range from data extraction to data loading. You can schedule pipeline activities, start them manually, or automatically trigger them.

1. On-premises databases like Db2 zOS, Db2 for i, and Db2 LUW store the data.

1. Pipelines group the activities that perform tasks. To extract data, Data Factory dynamically creates one pipeline per on-premises table. You can then use a massively parallel implementation when you replicate data in Azure. But you can also configure the solution to meet your requirements:

   - Full replication: You replicate the entire database, making necessary modifications to data types and fields in the target Azure database. 
   - Partial, delta, or incremental replication: You use *watermark columns* in source tables to sync updated rows with Azure databases. These columns contain either a continuously incrementing key or a time stamp indicating the table's last update.

   Data Factory also uses pipelines for the following transformation tasks:

   - Data type conversion
   - Data manipulation
   - Data formatting
   - Column derivation
   - Data flattening
   - Data sorting
   - Data filtering

1. A self-hosted integration runtime (IR) provides the environment that Data Factory uses to run and dispatch activities.

1. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Blob Storage provide a place for data staging. This step is sometimes required for transforming and merging data from multiple sources.

1. Data preparation takes place next. Data Factory uses Azure Databricks, custom activities, and pipeline data flows to transform data quickly and effectively.

1. Data Factory loads data into relational and non-relational Azure databases:

   - Azure SQL
   - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
   - Azure Cosmos DB
   - Azure Data Lake Storage
   - Azure Database for MariaDB
   - Azure Database for MySQL

   In certain use cases, other tools can also load data.

1. Other tools can also replicate and transform data:

   - Microsoft Service for Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA): These DRDA services can connect to the Azure SQL family of databases and keep on-premises databases up to date. These services run on an on-premises virtual machine (VM) or an Azure VM.
   - SQL Server Migration Assistance (SSMA) for Db2: This tool migrates schemas and data from IBM Db2 databases to Azure databases.
   - SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): This platform can extract, transform, and load data.
   - Third-party tools: When the solution requires near real-time replication, you can use third-party tools. Some of these agents are available in [Azure Marketplace][Azure Marketplace].

1. Azure Synapse Analytics manages the data and makes it available for business intelligence and machine learning applications.


## Components

The solution uses the following components:

### Tools

- [Microsoft Service for DRDA][Microsoft Service for DRDA] is a component of [Host Integration Server (HIS)][What is HIS]. Microsoft Service for DRDA is an Application Server (AS) that DRDA Application Requester (AR) clients use. Examples of DRDA AR clients include IBM Db2 for z/OS and Db2 for i5/OS. These clients use the AS to convert Db2 SQL statements and run them on SQL Server.

- [SSMA for Db2][SQL Server Migration Assistant for Db2] automates migration from Db2 to Microsoft database services. While running on a VM, this tool converts Db2 database objects into SQL Server database objects and creates those objects in SQL Server. SSMA for Db2 then migrates data from Db2 to the following services:

  - SQL Server 2012
  - SQL Server 2014
  - SQL Server 2016
  - SQL Server 2017 on Windows and Linux
  - SQL Server 2019 on Windows and Linux
  - Azure SQL Database

### Networking

- An [on-premises data gateway][What is an on-premises data gateway?] acts as a bridge that connects on-premises data with cloud services. Typically, you [install the gateway on a dedicated on-premises VM][Install an on-premises data gateway]. Cloud services can then securely use on-premises data.

- [Azure VMs][Azure virtual machines] are on-demand, scalable computing resources that are available with Azure. An Azure VM provides the flexibility of virtualization. But it eliminates the maintenance demands of physical hardware. Azure VMs offer a choice of operating systems, including Windows and Linux.

- An [IR][Integration runtime in Azure Data Factory] is the compute infrastructure that Data Factory uses to integrate data across different network environments. Data Factory uses [self-hosted IRs][Self-hosted integration runtime] to copy data between cloud data stores and data stores in on-premises networks.

## Recommendations

When you use Data Factory to extract data, take steps to [tune the performance of the copy activity][Performance tuning steps].

## Considerations

Keep these points in mind when considering this architecture.

### Availability considerations

- Infrastructure management, including [availability][Types of Databases on Azure], is automated in Azure databases.

- See [Pooling and failover][Pooling and failover] for information on the failover protection that Microsoft Service for DRDA provides.

- You can cluster the on-premises data gateway and IR to provide higher availability guarantees.

### Manageability considerations

- When you use an on-premises application gateway, be aware of [limits on read and write operations][Gateway considerations].

- To use SSMA for Db2, install the client program on a computer that can access the source Db2 database and the target instance of SQL Server. That computer should meet the requirements listed in [Installing SSMA for Db2 client][Installing SSMA for DB2 client (DB2ToSQL) Prerequisites].

- The [self-hosted IR can only run on a Windows operating system][Self-hosted IR compute resource and scaling].

### Scalability considerations

- Infrastructure management, including [scalability][Types of Databases on Azure], is automated in Azure databases.

- You can [scale out the self-hosted IR][Self-hosted IR compute resource and scaling] by associating the logical instance with multiple on-premises machines in active-active mode.

- You can cluster the on-premises data gateway and IR for scalability.

- Consider [Azure ExpressRoute][Azure ExpressRoute] as a high-scale option if your implementation uses significant bandwidth for initial replication or ongoing changed data replication.

### Security considerations

- The on-premises data gateway provides data protection during transfers from on-premises to Azure systems.

- See [Network transports and transactions] to learn about the types of client connections that Microsoft Service for DRDA supports.

- Ensure that the security level of the Azure environment that has access to the on-premises data gateway meets the security requirements of the on-premises network.
