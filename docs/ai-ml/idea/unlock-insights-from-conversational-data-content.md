### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the preceding diagram:

1. Raw call audio files and call transcripts exist in their source systems.

1. The audio files and transcripts are uploaded to an Azure Storage account as the initial data sources. The data processing pipeline analyzes audio and transcript files from customer service calls and creates a searchable knowledge base. In this ingestion phase, audio files are converted to text by using speech-to-text technology, while transcripts are directly processed for content analysis. This process occurs daily, but your scenario might require a different frequency.

1. Content Understanding processes both audio and text files to extract conversation details, entities, relationships, and contextual information. This service performs topic modeling and key phrase extraction to identify meaningful patterns within the conversational data. This data includes call-specific elements such as resolution status, customer satisfaction indicators, and compliance markers.

1. Extracted entities and processed conversation data are stored in Azure SQL Database for structured queries, while AI Search creates vectorized representations of call transcripts. These embeddings enable semantic search across the full set of transcripts and support complex queries related to call outcomes, agent performance, and customer sentiment trends.

1. Custom application code performs topic modeling on the extracted call transcript data from step 3. It automatically identifies and categorizes conversation themes, such as billing problems, technical support, or product feedback. This process uses Azure OpenAI models hosted in Azure AI Foundry as a managed service. Azure AI Foundry Agent Service orchestrates the workflow to analyze transcripts and extract topics. Topic modeling applies machine learning algorithms to discover patterns in language usage and group related words or phrases by assigning topic labels and confidence scores to each conversation. Results are saved to SQL Database, which enables automatic categorization and insight generation from customer calls at scale.

1. A scheduled batch processing pipeline runs periodically to process new data stored in the Storage account from steps 1 and 2. The pipeline uses Content Understanding services to analyze call audio files and transcripts. It extracts insights and transforms raw data into structured, searchable information. The processed results are written to AI Search, which stores vectorized call transcripts to enable semantic search capabilities, and SQL Database, which stores extracted entities and structured data. The pipeline can operate in single-threaded mode for sequential processing. Or it can operate in parallel across multiple threads to handle larger data volumes and improve processing throughput, depending on workload requirements and system capacity.

1. The orchestration layer within Azure App Service coordinates the overall workflow by managing data flow between services and providing API endpoints. It integrates Azure OpenAI models in Azure AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel for intelligent processing and response generation by using function calling capabilities to enhance the conversation analysis workflow. This orchestration is only for handling chat requests.

1. Users access a web front end hosted on App Service to explore call insights, chat with the data by using natural language queries, and generate visualizations. The interface provides conversational access to the processed knowledge base and enables queries such as *Show me all unresolved billing complaints from last month* or *What are the most common reasons for escalations?*

1. Azure Cosmos DB stores chat history and session data. It maintains conversation context for the interactive front-end experience and enables persistent user sessions across the application. The chat history is stored in Azure Cosmos DB, so Azure Cosmos DB only interacts with the app to pull the user's previous questions and answers. The data to be queried for new questions is in SQL Database and the AI Search index.
