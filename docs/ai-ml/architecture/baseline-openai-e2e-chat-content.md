Enterprise chat applications can empower employees through conversational interactions with AI agents. This point is especially true because of the continuous advancement of language models, such as OpenAI's GPT models and orchestration SDKs like Semantic Kernel. These chat applications typically consist of:

- A chat user interface (UI) that is integrated into a larger enterprise application, providing users with a conversational experience alongside other business functions.

- Data repositories that contain domain-specific information that's pertinent to the users' queries.

- Language models that reason over the domain-specific data to produce a relevant response.

- An orchestrator or agent that oversees the interactions between data sources, language models, and the end user.

This article provides a baseline architecture to help you build and deploy enterprise chat applications with [Azure AI Foundry](/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) that use [Azure OpenAI language models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models). The architecture uses a single agent, hosted in Azure AI Agent Service, to handle incoming messages from the users out to data stores to fetch grounding data for the language model.

The Chat UI follows the [baseline app services web application](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml) guidance for how to deploy a secure, zone-redundant, and highly available web application on Azure App Service. In that architecture, App Service communicates to the Azure platform as a service (PaaS) solution through virtual network integration over private endpoints. In the chat UI architecture, App Service communicates with the agent over a private endpoint. Public access to Azure AI Foundry portal and agents are disabled.

> This article doesn't describe the components or architecture decisions from the [baseline App Service web application](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml). Read that article for architectural guidance about how to host your web application containing your chat UI.

The architecture uses [Azure AI Agent Service standard agent setup](/azure/ai-services/agents/concepts/standard-agent-setup) to enable enterprise-grade security, compliance, and control. In this configuration, you bring your own network for network isolation and your own Azure resources to store chat and agent state. All communication between application components and Azure services occurs over private endpoints, ensuring that data traffic remains within your workload's virtual network. Outbound traffic from the agents is strictly routed through Azure Firewall, where egress rules are enforced.

## Architecture

:::image type="complex" source="_images/ai-foundry-end-to-end-baseline-deployment.svg" border="false" lightbox="_images/ai-foundry-end-to-end-baseline-deployment.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a baseline end-to-end chat architecture that uses Azure AI Foundry.":::
    The diagram presents a detailed Azure architecture for deploying an AI solution. On the left, a user connects through an Application Gateway with a web application firewall, which is part of a virtual network. This gateway is linked to private DNS zones and protected by DDoS Protection. Below the gateway, private endpoints connect to services such as App Service, Key Vault, and Storage, which are used for client app deployment. The App Service is managed with identity and spans three zones. Monitoring is provided by Application Insights and Azure Monitor, and authentication is handled by Microsoft Entra ID.
    Moving right, the virtual network contains several subnets: App Service integration, private endpoint, Azure AI Foundry integration, Azure AI Agent integration, Bastion, Jump box, Build agents, and Azure firewall. Each subnet hosts specific endpoints or services, such as storage, AI Foundry, AI Search, CosmosDB, and knowledge store, all connected via private endpoints. Outbound traffic from the network passes through the Azure Firewall to reach internet sources.
    To the far right, a separate box represents Azure AI Foundry, which includes an account and a project. Managed identities are used to connect the Azure AI Agent Service to the Azure AI Foundry project, which in turn accesses an Azure OpenAI Model. The diagram uses numbered green circles to indicate the logical flow, showing how user requests traverse the network, interact with various endpoints, and ultimately connect to AI services and storage, with dependencies clearly grouped and labeled.

### Workflow

1. An application user interacts with a chat interface. The requests are routed through Azure Application Gateway. Azure Web Application Firewall inspects these requests before they're forwarded to the backend Azure App Service.

1. Upon receiving a user's query or instruction, the web application invokes the purpose-built agent. Communication with the agent is performed with the Azure AI Agent SDK. The web application calls the agent over a private endpoint and authenticates to Azure AI Foundry using its managed identity.

1. The agent processes the user's request by following the instructions in its system prompt. The agent has a configured language model and connections to tools and knowledge stores it can use to fulfill the user's intent.

1. The agent connects to the knowledge store, Azure AI Search in this case, within the private network via a private endpoint.

1. Requests to external knowledge stores or tools, such as Wikipedia or Bing, traverse Azure Firewall for inspection and egress policy enforcement.

1. The agent connects to its configured language model, passing relevant context.

1. Before returning the response to the UI, the agent persists the request, its generated response, and a list of consulted knowledge stores into a dedicated 'memory' database. This database maintains the complete conversation history, enabling context-aware interactions and enabling users to resume conversations with the agent without losing prior context.

   The Azure AI Foundry APIs support the development of user experiences that manage multiple concurrent, context-isolated conversations.

### Components

This architecture builds on the [basic Azure OpenAI end-to-end chat architecture](./basic-openai-e2e-chat.yml#components) and introduces additional Azure services to address enterprise requirements for reliability, security, and operational control. The following components are included for their specific roles in a production enterprise chat solution:

- [Azure AI Agent Service](/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) provides the orchestration layer for chat interactions. It hosts and manages agents that process user requests, coordinate calls to tools and other agents, enforce content safety, and integrate with enterprise identity, networking, and observability.

  The [standard agent setup](/azure/ai-services/agents/concepts/standard-agent-setup) is used to ensure network isolation and your control over data storage. You supply dedicated Azure resources for agent state, chat history, and file storage, which are used exclusively by the AI Agent Service. These required resources are designed to be dedicated to the Azure AI Agent service and aren't intended to be used by other application concerns in the workload.

  - [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/cosmos-db) hosts this workload's 'memory' database (called `enterprise_memory`) within your subscription. This database stores the agent's operational state, including chat threads and agent definitions. This design ensures that chat history and agent configuration are isolated, auditable, and managed according to data governance requirements. The AI Agent Service manages the database, its collections, and the data within.

  - A dedicated [Azure Storage](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-blob-storage) account stores files uploaded during chat sessions. Hosting this account in your subscription allows for granular access control, auditing, and compliance with data residency or retention policies. The AI Agent Service manages the containers and data lifecycle within those containers.

  - A dedicated [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) instance store a searchable and chunked version of files uploaded as part of conversations with the agent. It also stores static files that are added as knowledge sources when the agent is created. The Azure AI Agent Service manages the index, schema, data. The service also uses its own chunking strategy and query logic.

- [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-application-gateway) acts as the secure, scalable entry point for all HTTP/S traffic to the chat UI. It provides TLS termination, path-based routing, and distributes requests across availability zones, supporting high availability and performance for the web application tier. Its backend is the App Service that hosts the application code.

  [Azure Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview) is integrated with Application Gateway to protect the chat UI from common web vulnerabilities and attacks. It inspects and filters HTTP requests, providing a security layer that is essential for public-facing applications.

  [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is used to securely store and manage the TLS certificates required by Application Gateway. Centralizing certificate management in Key Vault supports automated rotation, auditing, and compliance with organizational security standards. There are no keys or other secrets in this architecture to store.

- [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/virtual-network) provides network isolation for all components. By placing resources in a private virtual network, you control east-west and north-south traffic, enforce segmentation, keep traffic private, and enable inspection of all ingress and egress flows. This is critical for meeting security and compliance requirements.

- [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) is used to connect all PaaS services (such as Cosmos DB, Storage, AI Search, and AI Agent Service) to the virtual network via private endpoints. This approach ensures that all data traffic remains on the Azure backbone, eliminating exposure to the public internet and reducing the attack surface.

- [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/) is deployed to inspect and control all outbound (egress) traffic from the virtual network. It enforces fully qualified domain name (FQDN) based rules, ensuring that only approved destinations are reachable. This is essential for data exfiltration prevention and for meeting requirements for network security.

- [Azure DNS](/azure/dns/dns-overview) provides private DNS zones linked to the virtual network. This enables name resolution for private endpoints, ensuring that all service-to-service communication uses private IP addresses and remains within the network boundary.

- [Azure Storage](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-blob-storage) is also used to host the web application code (as a ZIP file) for deployment to Azure App Service. This supports secure, automated deployment workflows and separation of application artifacts from the compute.

### Alternatives

This architecture includes multiple components that can be implemented with other Azure services or approaches, depending on your workload's specific functional and nonfunctional requirements. The following alternatives highlight where you might substitute core components and the tradeoffs to consider.

#### Chat orchestration

**Current:** This architecture uses the [Azure AI Agent Service](/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) to orchestrate chat flows, including fetching grounding data from your knowledge stores and invoking Azure OpenAI models. The AI Agent Service provides codeless, nondeterministic orchestration, handling chat requests, thread management, tool invocation, content safety, and integration with identity, networking, and observability. It provides a native memory database solution.

**Alternative:** You can self-host the orchestration layer using frameworks such as [Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/overview/) or [LangChain](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/langchain). These frameworks allow you to implement deterministic, code-driven chat flows and custom orchestration logic. Consider this approach if you require:

- More deterministic control over the orchestration sequence, tool invocation, or prompt engineering.
- Integration with custom business logic or external systems not natively supported by Azure AI Agent Service.
- Advanced client request routing, supporting experimentation, or safe deployment practices.
- You need a memory database solution that follows a different approach than the one provided by the AI Agent Service.

Self-hosting increases operational complexity and requires you to manage compute, scaling, and security.

#### Application tier components

**Current:** The chat UI front end website is hosted on Azure App Service (Web Apps), which provides a managed, scalable platform for web applications with built-in integration to Azure networking and security features.

**Alternative:** You can use other Azure-managed compute platforms, such as Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), to host the application tier. Consider these alternatives if your workload:

- Has other use cases best served by another compute platform that you can colocate with for cost optimizations and operational duties.
- Advanced scaling, orchestration, or custom networking requirements.

App Service is preferred for simplicity of hosting web applications and their APIs.

#### Grounding data (knowledge) store

**Current:** This architecture uses Azure AI Search as the primary data store for grounding knowledge, using its vector search and semantic ranking capabilities.

**Alternative:** You might use other data platforms for grounding knowledge, such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, or other OLTP data stores, depending on your existing data estate, data freshness requirements, and query requirements. Consider alternatives if:

- Your grounding knowledge is already managed in an existing transactional or operational database.
- You require multi-model or SDK support not available for AI Search.
- You need to integrate with specialized data sources or legacy systems.

Vector search is common for retrieval-augmented generation, but not always required. For a detailed comparison, see [Choose an Azure service for vector search](/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/vector-search). Evaluate the data access patterns, latency, and scalability needs of your workload before selecting a data store.

#### Predefined agent or dynamically created agent

**Current:** The reference implementation uses a statically defined agent, effectively deployed as a microservice within Azure AI Foundry. The agent's logic and data sources are configured at deployment and remain unchanged until the next application release. This approach is suitable when agent behavior and data sources are stable and controlled through DevOps processes.

**Alternative:** You can dynamically create or modify agents at runtime using the Azure AI Agent SDK. This approach allows the application to instantiate agents on demand, adjust system prompts, or reconfigure connections based on user context or business logic. Consider dynamic agents if:

- You need to personalize agent behavior or data sources per user or session.
- Your application requires frequent or programmatic changes to agent configuration.
- You want to support ephemeral, context-specific agents for advanced user experiences.

Dynamic agent management increases flexibility but also introduces the burden of lifecycle management. Ensure you have appropriate controls for agent creation, modification, and cleanup.

Select the agent approach that aligns with your workload's user experience requirements.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

Apply this architecture and the design guidance in [AI workloads on Azure](/azure/well-architected/ai/get-started) during the design process for your specific workload.

### Reliability

Reliability helps ensure that your application can meet the commitments that you make to your customers. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist).

The baseline App Service web application architecture focuses on zonal redundancy for key regional services. Availability zones are physically separate locations within a region. They provide redundancy within a region for supporting services when two or more instances are deployed between them. When downtime happens in one zone, the other zones within the region might be unaffected. The architecture also helps ensure that enough instances and configurations of Azure services are spread across availability zones. For more information, see [Baseline highly available zone-redundant web application](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml).

This section addresses reliability from the perspective of the components in this architecture that aren't addressed in the App Service baseline architecture, including Azure AI Foundry and AI Search.

#### Zone redundancy in your orchestration layer

Enterprise deployments usually require zonal redundancy to minimize the risk of service disruption from zone-level failures. In Azure, this means using resources that support [availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) and deploying at least three instances, or enabling platform-level redundancy where direct instance control is unavailable.

In this architecture, Azure AI Foundry hosts the AI Agent capability. The agent's reliability is primarily tied to the availability of its dependencies: Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, and AI Search. While Azure AI Agent Service manages the data within these services, you're responsible for the reliability configuration of these resources in your subscription. To achieve zonal redundancy for the orchestration layer, follow these recommendations:

- Enable [zone redundancy in your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](/azure/reliability/reliability-cosmos-db-nosql#availability-zone-support) account. This configuration ensures data is synchronously replicated across multiple zones, reducing the risk of data loss or downtime from a single zone failure.

  Further, consider [global distribution](/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally) to mitigate regional outages within Cosmos DB.

- Use at least [zone-redundant storage (ZRS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs) for your Azure Storage account. For higher resilience, [Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs) is recommended, as it combines zonal and regional redundancy.

- Configure your [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-reliability#availability-zone-support) instance with at least three replicas. This configuration ensures that the service distributes replicas across unique zones in your region.

If your agent integrates with other workload-specific dependencies (such as custom tool connections or external knowledge stores), you must ensure that those dependencies meet your availability and redundancy requirements. Any single-zone or non-redundant dependency can undermine the overall reliability of the orchestration layer.

Be aware that the AI Foundry portal, its data plane APIs, nor the AI Agent capability provide direct controls for zone redundancy.

#### Reliability in Azure AI Foundry model hosting

Azure AI Foundry offers Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) hosting with several deployment options. These options are primarily designed for quota and throughput management, not for traditional high availability within a region. Standard model deployments are limited to a single region and don't support availability zones. To achieve multi-datacenter availability, you must use either a global or a data zone model deployment.

For enterprise chat scenarios, deploy both a [Data zone provisioned](/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/deployment-types#data-zone-provisioned) and [Data zone standard](/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/deployment-types#data-zone-standard) model, and configure [spillover](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/spillover-traffic-management) to handle excess traffic or failures. If your workload isn't constrained by latency or geographic data residency and processing, global deployment types provide the highest resilience and should be preferred.

Be aware that Azure AI Foundry doesn't support advanced load balancing or failover mechanisms (such as round-robin or [circuit breaking](/azure/api-management/backends#circuit-breaker)) for model deployments. If you require granular redundancy and failover control within a region, you must host your model access logic outside of the managed service—using, for example, a custom gateway implemented in Azure API Management. This approach allows you to implement custom routing, health checks, and failover strategies, but increases operational complexity and shifts responsibility for reliability of that component to your team. You can also expose gateway-fronted models as custom API-based tools or knowledge stores for your agent. For more, see [Use a gateway in front of multiple Azure OpenAI deployments or instances](../guide/azure-openai-gateway-multi-backend.yml).

#### Reliability in AI Search for enterprise knowledge

Deploy Azure AI Search using the Standard pricing tier or higher in a [region that supports availability zones](/azure/search/search-reliability#prerequisites). Configure at least three replicas to ensure that the service distributes instances across separate availability zones. This configuration provides resilience to zone-level failures and supports high availability for search operations.

To determine the optimal number of replicas and partitions for your workload:

- [Monitor AI Search](/azure/search/monitor-azure-cognitive-search) using built-in metrics and logs. Track query latency, throttling, and resource utilization.

- Use monitoring metrics and logs and performance analysis to determine the appropriate number of replicas. This approach helps you avoid query-based throttling and partitions and index-based throttling.

Ensuring periodic indexing or indexing errors don't impact the availability of the data within the index. Consider indexing in an offline index and swapping from your live index to your rebuilt index after data integrity validation is complete.

#### Reliability in Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall is a critical egress control point in this architecture but represents a single point of failure for all outbound traffic. To mitigate this risk, deploy Azure Firewall [across all availability zones](/azure/firewall/basic-features#built-in-high-availability) in your region. This configuration helps maintain outbound connectivity if a zone becomes unavailable.

If your workload requires a high volume of concurrent outbound connections, configure Azure Firewall with multiple public IP addresses. This approach distributes SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) connections across [multiple address prefixes](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-address-prefix), reducing the risk of SNAT port exhaustion. [SNAT exhaustion](/azure/firewall/firewall-best-practices#recommendations) can cause intermittent or total loss of outbound connectivity for agents and other workload components, resulting in feature downtime or degraded performance.

Monitor [SNAT port usage and firewall health](/azure/firewall/monitor-firewall#analyze-monitoring-data). If you observe connection failures or throughput issues, review firewall metrics and logs to identify and address SNAT exhaustion or other bottlenecks.

#### Bulkhead Azure AI Agent dependencies from similar workload components

To maximize reliability and minimize the blast radius of failures, strictly isolate the Azure AI Agent Service's dependencies from other workload components that are designed to use the same Azure services. Namely, don't share Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB, or Azure Storage resources between the agent service and other application components. Instead, provision dedicated instances for the agent service's required dependencies. This separation enables you to:

- Contain failures or performance degradation to a single workload segment, preventing cascading impacts across unrelated application features.

- Apply targeted operational processes, such as backup, restore, and failover that are tuned to the specific availability and recovery requirements of the workload flow using those resources.

For example, if your chat UI application needs to store transactional state in Cosmos DB, provision a separate Cosmos DB account and database for that purpose, rather than reusing the account or database managed by the Azure AI Agent Service. Even if cost or operational simplicity motivates resource sharing, the risk of a reliability event impacting unrelated workload features outweighs the potential savings in most enterprise scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to colocate workload-specific data with the agent's dependencies for cost or operational reasons, never interact directly with the system-managed data (such as collections, containers, or indexes) created by the Azure AI Agent Service. These internal implementation details are undocumented and subject to change without notice. Direct access can break the agent service or result in data loss. Always use the Azure AI Agent Service data plane APIs for any data manipulation, and treat the underlying data as opaque and monitor-only.

#### Multiple-region design

This architecture is designed for high availability within a single Azure region using availability zones. It's not a multi-region solution. It lacks the following critical elements required for regional resiliency and disaster recovery:

- Global ingress and traffic routing
- DNS management for failover
- Data replication or isolation strategies across regions
- An active-active, active-passive, or active-cold designation
- A regional failover and failback processes to meet recovery time and recovery point objectives
- Consideration of region availability for developer experiences, including Azure AI Foundry portal and data plane APIs

If your workload requires business continuity in the event of a regional outage, you must design and implement additional components and operational processes beyond what is provided here. Specifically, you need to address load balancing and failover at each architectural layer:

- Grounding data (knowledge stores)
- Model hosting and inference endpoints
- Orchestration/agent layer
- User-facing UI traffic and DNS entry points

You must also ensure that observability, monitoring, and content safety controls remain operational and consistent across regions.

The absence of these multi-region capabilities in this baseline architecture means that regional outages likely result in loss of service within your workload.

#### Disaster recovery

Chat architectures contain stateful components, making disaster recovery (DR) planning essential. These workloads typically require a memory store for active or paused chat sessions, and storage for ad-hoc data added to chat threads, such as documents or images. The agent orchestration layer might also maintain state specific to conversation flows. In this architecture, Azure AI Agent Service uses Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, and Azure AI Search to persist operational and transactional state. The lifecycle and coupling of this state across components determines your DR strategy and recovery operations.

For Azure AI Agent Service, you must ensure that all dependencies can be recovered to a consistent point in time. This is critical for maintaining transactional integrity across the three external dependencies. The following recommendations address DR for each service.

- **Cosmos DB**: Enable [continuous backup](/azure/cosmos-db/online-backup-and-restore) for the `enterprise_memory` database. This provides point-in-time restore (PITR) with a seven-day recovery point objective (RPO), covering both agent definitions and chat threads. Test your restore process regularly to validate that you can meet your recovery time objective (RTO) and that restored data is referenced and usable by the agent service. You need to restore to the same account and database.

- **Azure AI Search**: There's no built-in restore capability for AI Search. Furthermore, direct manipulation of index data used by this service is unsupported. In the event of data loss or corruption, you must contact Microsoft support for assistance with index restoration. This limitation can significantly impact your RTO. If your chat UI doesn't support file uploads and you haven't created agents with static files as knowledge, the AI Search instance might go unused and not require DR planning.

  For your enterprise grounding knowledge usage of AI Search, always maintain a separate, regularly updated source of truth for your knowledge base to enable index reconstruction if needed.

- **Azure Storage**: For blob containers used by Azure AI Agent Service, use [customer-managed failover](/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance#customer-managed-unplanned-failover) if you have a geo-redundant storage account. This allows you to initiate failover in the event of a regional outage. If you use only zone-redundant storage, restoration requires contacting Microsoft support, which can extend your RTO. As with AI Search, if your chat UI doesn't support file uploads and you haven't created agents with static files as knowledge, the blob containers might be unused and not require DR planning.

- **Transactional consistency**: If your workload's own state store references Azure AI Agent identifiers (such as thread IDs or agent IDs), you must coordinate recovery across all relevant data stores. Restoring only a subset of dependencies can result in orphaned or inconsistent data. Design your DR processes to maintain referential integrity between your workload and the agent service's state.

- **Agent definitions and configuration**: Define agents "as code". Store agent definitions, connections, system prompts, and parameters in source control. This practice enables you to redeploy agents from a known good configuration in the event of a complete loss of the orchestration layer. Avoid making ad-hoc changes to agent configuration through the AI Foundry portal or data plane APIs that aren't tracked in source control. This approach ensures that your deployed agents are reproducible.

Before going to production, invest time to build a recovery runbook that addresses failures in both application-owned state and agent agent-owned state.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Security](/azure/well-architected/security/checklist).

This architecture extends the security footprint implemented in [Basic OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture](./basic-openai-e2e-chat.yml). The primary difference is that this architecture implements a network security perimeter in addition to the identity perimeter that the basic architecture implements. From a network perspective, the Application Gateway is the only internet exposed resource, as it's responsible for making the chat UI application available to users. From an identity perspective, the chat UI should authenticate and authorize requests. Use managed identities when possible to authenticate applications to Azure services.

This section describes networking and security considerations for key rotation and Azure OpenAI model fine-tuning.

#### Identity and access management

This architecture primarily uses system-assigned managed identities for service-to-service authentication, but you may use user-assigned managed identities. In either case, apply the following principles:

- Isolate identities by resource and function. Provision distinct managed identities for:

  - The Azure AI Foundry account
  - Each Azure AI Foundry project
  - The web application
  - Any custom orchestrator or integration code

- Assign an identity to an Azure resource only if that resource must authenticate as a client to another Azure service.

- Use fit-for-purpose identity types. Where possible, use [workload identities](/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-overview) for applications and automation, and [agent identities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/announcing-microsoft-entra-agent-id-secure-and-manage-your-ai-agents/3827392) for AI agents.

##### Azure AI Foundry portal employee access

When onboarding employees to Azure AI Foundry projects, assign the minimum set of permissions required for their role. Use Microsoft Entra ID groups and RBAC to enforce separation of duties. For example, distinguish agent developers from data scientists performing fine tuning. However, be aware of the following limitations and risks:

Azure AI Foundry portal operates with the service's own identity, not the employee's, for many actions. This means that even employees with limited RBAC roles might have visibility into sensitive data such as chat threads, agent definitions, and configuration. This AI Foundry portal design can inadvertently bypass your desired access constraints, exposing more information than intended.

To mitigate the risk of undesired access, restrict portal usage in production environments to only those employees with a clear operational need. For most employees, disable or block access to the Azure AI Foundry portal in production. Instead, use automated deployment pipelines and infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage agent and project configuration.

The ability to create new projects in an Azure AI Foundry account is a high-privilege action. Projects created via the portal don't automatically inherit your established network security controls, such as private endpoints or NSGs, and new agents in those projects bypass your intended security perimeter. Enforce that project creation is performed only through your controlled, auditable IaC processes.

##### Azure AI Foundry project role assignments and connections

To use Azure AI Agent service in the standard mode, the project must have administrative permissions on the Azure AI Agent Service's dependencies. Specifically, the project's managed identity must be granted elevated role assignments on the Azure Storage account, Azure AI Search, and Azure Cosmos DB account. These permissions provide nearly full access to these resources, including the ability to read, write, modify, or delete data. These elevated permissions are another reason to isolate your workload resources from the Azure AI Agent Service's dependencies, keeping least privilege access.

Additionally, all agents within a single AI Foundry project share the same managed identity. If your workload uses multiple agents that require access to different sets of resources, the principle of least privilege requires you to create a separate Azure AI Foundry project for each distinct agent access pattern. This separation allows you to assign only the minimum required permissions to each project's managed identity, reducing the risk of excessive or unintended access.

When establishing [connections](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/connections-add) to external resources from within Azure AI Foundry, always prefer to use Entra ID based authentication if available. This approach avoids maintaining preshared secrets. Always scope each connection so that it's usable only by the project that owns it. If multiple projects require access to the same resource, create a separate connection in each project, rather than sharing a single connection across projects. This practice enforces strict access boundaries and prevents future projects from inheriting access they don't require.

Connections created at the Azure AI Foundry account level are shared across all projects in the account, both current and future. This can inadvertently grant broad access to resources beyond what is intended, undermining least privilege and increasing the risk of unauthorized data exposure. Prefer project-level connections only.

#### Networking

In addition to identity-based access, network confidentiality is a foundational requirement for this architecture. The network design enforces:

- A single, secure entry point for all chat UI traffic, minimizing the attack surface.
- Filtered ingress and egress network traffic, using a combination of network security groups (NSGs), Web Application Firewall (WAF), user-defined routes (UDRs), and Azure Firewall rules.
- End-to-end encryption of data in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
- Network privacy by using Private Link for all Azure PaaS service connections.
- Logical segmentation and isolation of network resources, with dedicated subnets for each major component grouping, to support granular security policies.

##### Network flows

:::image type="complex" source="_images/ai-foundry-end-to-end-chat-network-flow.svg" border="false" lightbox="_images/ai-foundry-end-to-end-chat-network-flow.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a numbered flow in a baseline end-to-end chat architecture that uses OpenAI.":::
    The diagram resembles the baseline end-to-end chat architecture. It includes the Azure OpenAI architecture and three numbered network flows. The inbound flow and the flow from App Service to Azure PaaS services are copied from the baseline App Service web architecture. The Azure AI Agent Service flow shows an arrow from the Azure AI Foundry private endpoint in the private virtual network that points to the Azure AI Agent Service. The second numbered arrow in the Azure AI Agent Service flow shows calls from the Azure AI Agent virtual interface in the private network flowing through private endpoints. The third numbered arrow shows an arrow from the virtual interface to an Azure Firewall box indicating that all calls to the internet flow through that firewall.
:::image-end:::

The inbound flow from the user to the chat UI and the flow from App Service to [Azure PaaS services](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml#app-service-to-azure-paas-services-flow), are detailed in the [baseline App Service web application architecture](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml). This section focuses on the Azure AI Agent interactions. When the chat UI communicates with the agent deployed in Azure AI Foundry, the following network flows occur:

1. The App Service-hosted chat UI initiates an HTTPS request that is routed through a private endpoint to the Azure AI Foundry data plane API endpoint.
1. When the agent accesses Azure PaaS services (such as service dependencies, custom knowledge stores, or custom tools), HTTPS requests are routed from the delegated subnet to the private endpoints of those services.
1. When the agent accesses resources outside the virtual network (including internet-based APIs or external services), HTTPS requests are routed from the delegated subnet through Azure Firewall.

Private endpoints are a critical security control in this architecture, supplementing identity-based security.

##### Ingress to Azure AI Foundry

In this architecture, public access to the Azure AI Foundry data plane is disabled by using [private link for Azure AI Foundry](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/configure-private-link). Although much of the AI Foundry portal is accessible at <https://ai.azure.com>, all project-level functionality in the portal is unavailable unless the employee is connected from within the network. The portal relies on your AI Foundry account's data plane APIs, which are only reachable via private endpoints. As a result, developers and data scientists must access the portal through a jump box, a peered virtual network, or a site-to-site VPN/ExpressRoute connection.

Similarly, all programmatic interactions with the agent data plane, such as from the web application or when invoking model inferencing from external orchestration code, must use these private endpoints. Private endpoints are defined at the account level, not the project level. Therefore, all projects within the account are accessible from the same set of endpoints. Network segmentation at the project level isn't possible, and all projects share the same network exposure.

You must configure DNS for the following three Azure AI Foundry FQDN API endpoints:

- `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com`
- `privatelink.openai.azure.com`
- `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com`

The diagram illustrates how an AI developer connects through Azure Bastion to a virtual machine (VM) jump box. From that jump box, the author can access the project in the AI Foundry portal through a private endpoint in the same network.

##### Control traffic from Azure AI Foundry agent subnet

This architecture enforces that all outbound (egress) network traffic from the Azure AI Foundry agent capability is routed through a delegated subnet within your virtual network. This subnet acts as the sole egress point for both the agent's required three service dependencies and any external knowledge or tool connections the agent is configured to use. The goal with this design is to reduce data exfiltration attempts from within the orchestration logic.

By forcing egress to happen this way, you can apply granular network security group (NSG) rules, custom routing, and DNS control to all agent traffic leaving the service.

The agent service uses the virtual network's DNS configuration to resolve private endpoint records and any required external FQDNs. As such, the agent's requests can be integrated with DNS logging for audit and troubleshooting purposes.

The NSG attached to the agent egress subnet blocks all inbound traffic, as no legitimate ingress should occur. Outbound NSG rules are configured to allow only access to private endpoints subnet within the virtual network and port 443 TCP traffic to the internet. All other traffic is denied.

To further restrict the internet traffic, a user-defined route (UDR) is applied to this subnet to force all HTTPS requests leaving the virtual network through Azure Firewall. The firewall enforces which fully qualified domain names (FQDN) the agents are allowed to access. For example, if your agent only needs to access the [Grounding with Bing](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding) public APIs, you'd configure the Azure Firewall to allow only `api.bing.microsoft.com` on port 443 from this subnet. All other outbound destinations are denied.

##### Virtual network segmentation and security

This architecture implements network segmentation by assigning each major component group to its own subnet within the virtual network. Each subnet has a dedicated network security group (NSG) that limits the inbound and outbound traffic to only what's required for its function in this workload. The table below summarizes the NSG and firewall configuration for each subnet:

| Usage / subnet name                   | Inbound traffic (NSG)  | Outbound traffic (NSG)         | UDR to firewall | Firewall egress rules |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------: | :-------------------- |
| Private endpoints<br>`snet-privateEndpoints` | Virtual network | No traffic allowed             | Yes             | No traffic allowed    |
| Application Gateway<br>`snet-appGateway`     | Chat UI user source IP addresses, such as the public internet, and required sources for the service | Private endpoint subnet and required items for the service | No | - |
| App Service<br>`snet-appServicePlan`  | No traffic allowed     | Private endpoints and Azure Monitor | Yes        | To Azure Monitor      |
| Azure AI Agent<br>`snet-agentsEgress` | No traffic allowed     | Private endpoints and internet | Yes             | Only those public FQDNs you allow your agents to use |
| Jump box VMs<br>`snet-jumpBoxes`      | Azure Bastion subnet   | Private endpoints and internet | Yes             | As needed by VM       |
| Build agents<br>`snet-buildAgents`    | Azure Bastion subnet   | Private endpoints and internet | Yes             | As needed by VM       |
| Azure Bastion<br>`AzureBastionSubnet` | See [NSG access and Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-nsg). | See [NSG access and Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-nsg). | No | - |
| Azure Firewall<br>`AzureFirewallSubnet`<br>`AzureFirewallManagementSubnet` | No NSG | No NSG    | No              | -                     |

All other traffic is explicitly denied, either through explicit NSG rules or by default in Azure Firewall.

When implementing network segmentation and security in this architecture, follow these recommendations:

- Deploy a [Azure DDoS Protection](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview) plan on the Application Gateway public IP to mitigate volumetric attacks.

- Attach an [NSG](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) to every subnet that allows NSGs. Use the strictest rules that don't block required functionality.

- Apply [forced tunneling](/azure/firewall/forced-tunneling) to all supported subnets, ensuring that all your egress firewall inspects all outbound traffic. Forced tunneling should be used even on subnets where you don't expect egress, as a defense-in-depth measure to protect against intentional or unintentional misuse of the subnet.

#### Governance through policy

To help ensure alignment with your workload's security baseline, use Azure Policy and network policies to enforce that all workload resources meet your requirements. Platform automation through policy reduces the risk of security configuration drift and helps reduce manual validation activities. Consider the following recommended types security policies this architecture can benefit from.

- Disable key-based or other local authentication methods in services like Azure AI services and Key Vault.
- Require explicit configuration of network access rules, private endpoints, and NSGs.
- Require encryption, such as the use of customer-managed keys.
- Enforce controls on resource creation, such as limiting which regions or resource types can be used.

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

To see a pricing example for this architecture, use this prebuilt [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/9ed058e3b57b4386b7ac1bd3f782a344) estimate. You need to customize the example to match your usage because this example only includes the components that this architecture uses. The most expensive components in the scenario are Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, and Azure DDoS Protection. Other notable costs include the chat UI compute and Application Gateway. Optimize those resources to reduce costs.

#### Azure AI Agent Service

When using the standard deployment, you're responsible for provisioning and managing the service's dependencies in your own Azure subscription. The following recommendations clarify how to optimize costs for these required services.

- The Azure AI Agent service manages the request units (RUs) allocation on Cosmos DB. The most effective way to reduce long-term costs is to purchase reserved capacity for Cosmos DB, aligning reservations with your expected usage duration and volume. However, reserved capacity requires upfront commitment and might not be flexible if your workload's usage patterns change significantly.

- If your chat scenario doesn't require file uploads, don't code this feature in your application. When file uploads aren't needed:

  - Use a locally redundant storage (LRS) tier for the Storage account.
  - Configure Azure AI Search with a single replica instead of the recommended three.

- Regularly delete unused agents and their associated threads using the SDK or REST APIs. Stale agents and threads continue to consume storage and can increase costs across Cosmos DB, Storage, and AI Search.

- Disable features on dependent resources that aren't required for your workload. For example:

  - Semantic ranker in AI Search
  - Gateway and multi-master writing features in Cosmos DB

- Deploy all three dependencies (Cosmos DB, Storage, AI Search) in the same Azure region as the Azure AI Agent service. This avoids cross-region bandwidth charges.

- Avoid colocating workload-specific data in the same Cosmos DB or AI Search resources used by the AI Agent service. However, in some cases, sharing these resources to avoid unused capacity in request units (RUs) or search units can be a strategic cost optimization. Only consider resource sharing after a thorough risk assessment for reliability, security, and performance tradeoffs.

#### Agent knowledge and tools

The Azure AI Agent service executes agent logic in a nondeterministic manner, meaning it may invoke any connected knowledge store, tool, or other agent for each request, regardless of whether that resource is ultimately relevant to the specific user query. This can result in unnecessary calls to external APIs or data sources, increasing per-transaction costs and potentially introducing unpredictable usage patterns leading to budget forecasting challenges.

To control costs and maintain predictable behavior:

- Only connect knowledge stores, tools, or agents that you expect to be used with most agent invocations. Avoid connecting resources that are rarely needed or that incur high per-call costs unless essential.

- Carefully design and refine your agent's system prompt to try to instruct it to minimize unnecessary or redundant external calls. The system prompt should guide the agent to use only the most relevant connections for each request.

- Use Azure AI Foundry telemetry to monitor which external APIs, knowledge stores, or tools are being accessed, how often, and at what cost. Regularly review this telemetry to identify unexpected usage patterns or cost spikes, and adjust your agent prompt as needed.

- Be aware that nondeterministic invocation can make it difficult to forecast costs, especially when integrating with metered APIs. If cost predictability is a requirement, you might consider self-hosting your orchestrator using code that can be more deterministic.

#### Azure OpenAI models

Model deployments in Azure AI Foundry use the models-as-a-service (MaaS) approach, with costs driven primarily by usage or pre-provisioned allocation. Controlling demand is the primary way to control consumption model costs in this architecture. Use a combination of approaches.

- **Control clients.** Client requests are the primary source of cost in a consumption model, so controlling agent behavior is crucial. All model consumers should:

  - Be approved. Avoid exposing the models in a way that supports free-for-all access.

  - Be self controlled. Require agents to use the token-limiting constraints that API calls provide, such as max_tokens and max_completions. This is only possible in self-hosted orchestration approaches. Azure AI Agent service doesn't provide this limiting functionality.

  - Optimize prompt input and response length. Longer prompts consume more tokens, which increases cost. Prompts that lack sufficient context don't help the models produce good results. Create concise prompts that provide enough context to allow the model to generate a useful response. Ensure that you optimize the limit of the response length.

    This is only possible in self-hosted orchestration approaches. Azure AI Agent service doesn't provide enough configuration to control this.

- **Choose the right model for the agent.** Select the least expensive model that meets your agent's requirements. Avoid overprovisioning with higher-cost models unless necessary. For example, the reference implementation uses GPT-4o instead of a more expensive model and achieves sufficient results.

- **Monitor and manage usage.** Use [Azure cost management](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/manage-costs) and model telemetry to track token usage, set budgets, and create alerts for anomalies. Regularly review usage patterns and adjust quotas or client access as needed. See, [Plan and manage costs for Azure AI Foundry](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/costs-plan-manage).

- **Use the right deployment type.** Use pay-as-you-go for unpredictable workloads, and switch to provisioned throughput when usage is stable and predictable. Combine both when you have a baseline established.

- **Restrict playground usage.** Restrict use of the Azure AI Foundry playground to preproduction environments to prevent unplanned production costs.

- **Fine-tuning and image generation.** Be aware that fine-tuning and image generation are billed differently (per hour or per batch). Plan usage to maximize value within billing intervals.

#### Network security resources

Azure Firewall is a required egress control point in this architecture. To optimize costs, use the Basic tier of Azure Firewall unless the rest of your workload components requires advanced features. Higher tiers add cost and are only justified if you need their capabilities.

If your organization uses Azure landing zones, consider using shared firewall and DDoS resources to defer or reduce costs. Shared resources can be effective for workloads with similar security and performance requirements, but ensure that sharing doesn't introduce security or operational risks. See what shared resources are used when this [Azure AI Foundry chat baseline is deployed in an Azure landing zone](./azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone.yml).

### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Operational Excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist).

This operational excellence guidance doesn't include the front-end application elements, which are unchanged from the [baseline highly available zone-redundant web application architecture](../../web-apps/app-service/architectures/baseline-zone-redundant.yml#deployment-flow).

#### Agent compute

Microsoft fully manages the serverless compute platform for Azure AI Agent REST APIs and the orchestration execution logic. If you self-host orchestration, as mentioned in the [alternatives](#alternatives), you gain more control over runtime characteristics and capacity however you'll be directly responsible for all day-2 operations relevant for that platform. You need to evaluate the constraints and responsibilities inherit in your selected approach to understand what day-2 operations need to be designed to support your orchestration layer.

In both approaches, state storage, such as chat history and agent configuration must be managed for durability, backup, and recovery.

#### Monitoring

Like in the basic architecture, diagnostics are configured for all services, sinking those streams to your workload's Log Analytics workspace. All services except App Service are configured to capture all logs. In production, all logs are likely excessive. For example, the chat UI application might only require `AppServiceHTTPLogs`, `AppServiceConsoleLogs`, `AppServiceAppLogs`, `AppServicePlatformLogs`, and `AppServiceAuthenticationLogs`. Tune log streams to your operational needs.

Evaluate building custom alerts, such as those found in the Azure Monitor baseline alerts, for the resources in this architecture. For example:

- [Azure AI Search alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/services/Search/searchServices/)
- [Azure AI Services alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/services/CognitiveServices/accounts/)
- [Web Apps alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/services/Web/serverFarms/)

Be sure to monitor the usage of tokens against your model deployments. In this architecture, Azure AI Foundry tracks [token usage](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/monitor-quality-safety) through its integration with Application Insights.

Your jump boxes and build agent VMs are placed in a highly privileged location which gives those virtual machines, by design, network line of sight to the data plane of all components in your architecture. Ensure those VMs emit enough logs to understand when they're being used, by whom, and what actions they're performing.

#### Agent versioning and lifecycle

Treat each agent as an independently deployable unit within your chat workload, unless your application is specifically designed to dynamically create and delete agents at runtime. These agents have lifecycle management requirements similar to other microservices in your workload. Ensuring safe and controlled deployment of agents is critical to prevent service disruptions.

- **Define agents as code.** Always store agent definitions, connections, system prompts, and configuration parameters in source control. This practice ensures traceability and reproducibility. Avoid untracked changes made through the Azure AI Foundry portal.

- **Automate agent deployment.** Use your workload's CI/CD pipelines and use the AI Agent SDK to build, test, and deploy agent changes from your network-connected build agents.

  Aim for agent pipelines that can be deployed independently for small, incremental changes, but are also flexible enough to be deployed together with your application code when coordinated updates are required. To support this, loosely couple your chat UI code and your chat agents, so that changes to one don't require simultaneous changes to the other.

- **Test before production.** Validate agent behavior, prompts, and connections in preproduction environments. Use a combination of automated and manual tests to catch regressions, security issues, and unintended changes in agent behavior.

  Because agents defined in Azure AI Agent Service are nondeterministic, you must determine how to measure and maintain your desired quality level. This involves creating and executing a suite of tests that check for ideal responses to realistic user questions and scenarios.

- **Version and track agents.** Assign clear version identifiers to each agent. Maintain records of which agent versions are active, along with their dependencies such as models, data sources, and tools. Prefer deploying new agent versions side-by-side with existing ones to enable progressive rollout, rollback, and controlled migration of users or sessions.

- **Plan for failback.** Azure AI Foundry doesn't provide built-in support for blue-green or canary deployments of agents. If you require these deployment patterns, implement a routing layer (such as an API gateway or custom router) in front of the agent API. This allows you to incrementally shift traffic between agent versions, monitor the impact, and perform a full cutover when ready.

- **Coordinate agent removal.** When removing agents, coordinate the process with your application's state management and user experience requirements. Ensure that active chat sessions are handled appropriately. This might involve migrating sessions, pinning users to the old agent version, or requiring users to start new sessions, depending on your workload's functional requirements.

### Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Performance Efficiency](/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/checklist).

This section addresses performance efficiency for Azure AI Search, Azure AI Foundry, and model deployments.

#### Performance Efficiency in AI Search

When using Azure AI Agent service, you don't control the specific queries sent to your indexes because agents are codeless. To optimize performance, focus on what you can control with the index by observing how your agent typically queries the index. Follow the guidance to [analyze and optimize performance in AI Search](/azure/search/search-performance-analysis).

If you encounter bottlenecks that can't be resolved through index server tuning alone, consider these options:

- Replace the direct connection to Azure AI Search with a connection to an API that you own. This API can implement code optimized for your agent's retrieval patterns.
- Redesign the orchestration layer to use the [self-hosted alternative](#chat-orchestration), allowing you to define and optimize queries in your own orchestrator code.

#### Performance Efficiency in model deployments

- Decide if your application needs [provisioned throughput](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/provisioned-throughput) or can use the shared (consumption) model. Provisioned throughput provides reserved capacity and predictable latency, which is important for production workloads with strict SLOs. The consumption model is best-effort and might be affected by noisy neighbor effects.

- Monitor [provision-managed utilization](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/monitoring) to ensure you're not over or under-provisioned.

- Choose a conversational model that meets your inference latency requirements.

- Deploy models in the same data region as your agents to minimize network latency.

#### Azure AI Agent performance

Azure AI Agents run on a serverless compute backend that doesn't support custom performance tuning. However, you can still improve performance through agent design:

- Minimize the number of knowledge stores and tools connected to your chat agent. Each additional connection potentially increases the total execution time for an agent call, as the agent may invoke all configured resources per request.

- Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to track agent invocation times, tool/knowledge store latencies, and error rates. Regularly review this telemetry to identify slow knowledge or tool connections.

- Design system prompts to guide the agent to use connections efficiently. For example, instruct the agent to query external knowledge stores only when needed, or to avoid redundant tool invocations.

- Although serverless compute scales automatically, be aware of service limits or quotas that could affect peak load scenarios. Monitor for throttling (HTTP 429/503 responses).
