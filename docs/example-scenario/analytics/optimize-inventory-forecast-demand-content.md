Retail competition between companies is intense, and retailers are required to bring computational intelligence and smart insights into their commercial, marketing, and manufactory processes. While increasing and retaining customers is paramount for the success of a company, retailers must also align their inventory levels to customer demand to maximize operational efficiency and reduce waste and costs.

*Inventory optimization* is the process of providing the right inventory, in the right quantities, at the right locations to meet the customer demand. The objective of optimization is to lessen the carrying, storing, and maintenance costs, while meeting the needs of customers and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. *Demand forecasting* is the process of making predictions about customer demand by using various historical and third-party data. Demand forecasting helps business leaders to make informed decisions and is one of the most widely used techniques of inventory optimization. 

This article showcases a practical, scalable, and manageable solution for implementing inventory optimization architectures for the retail industry. The solution uses the latest advancements in forecasting, optimization, and parallel computing. To better work with a large volume of supply chain data, it offers the following guidelines for transforming and scaling existing on-premises solutions:

-   Provide a customer interface by using Power BI and PowerApps from which users can launch simulations and determine the parameters of the simulation and data, access results, and so on.

-   Process, validate, and analyze data by using Azure Machine Learning.

-   Generate probabilistic forecasts of inventory supply levels by using advanced machine learning methods, such as DeepAR.

-   Run parallel simulations for generating and forecasting inventory by using Azure Kubernetes and Ray.

## Potential use cases

This solution is designed for the retail industry, but it also applies to the manufacturing industry and to the following scenarios:

-   Analyze product information across locations to assess demand levels and decrease inventory costs.

-   Analyze stock variability and sales by using historical demand data to forecast demand in future periods, across customers, and by location and sales channel. For example, a shipping and delivery company needs to predict the quantities of products at different locations, and an insurer might want to know the number of products that will be returned because of failures.

-   Identify the ideal amount of inventory to have in stock.

-   Predict how seasonal changes or other events might affect sales and restocking options.

-   Forecast the prices of commodities across locations and sales channels by using historical transaction data in a retail context.

Companies can have a wide variety of inventory types, and specific types might be present only in specific locations or available from a subset of factories. Companies must also meet service level agreements and other relevant metrics. So, forecasts must account for the time at which a specific unit is available at a specific location, in addition to forecasting demand, service level agreements, and other relevant metrics. Successful inventory management requires accurate simulations for forecasting demand, utilization of distributed computing resources, and methodologies that can predict for multiple time granularities, product types, and locations.

Often, the data that's required to optimize inventory is sparse and not centrally located, which makes aggregating and analyzing it difficult. Most companies rely on commercial software. However, such systems hit scalability limits due to the ever-increasing amount of data and the complexity of data storage systems.

Methods of forecasting demand include on-point predictions, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations, time-series analysis, and data science methodologies. Some of these methods can take historical sales and seasonality effects into account, but more complex parameters require sophisticated methodologies for high-quality forecasts.

### Dataflow

1.  Azure Data Factory ingests related data into Azure Data Lake Storage. The sources of this data can be enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, SAP, and Azure SQL. Additional sources might include weather and economic data.

2.  Data Lake Storage stores raw data for further processing.

3.  Mapping data flows in Azure Data Factory produces curated data and stores it in a relational format in an Azure SQL database. Additionally, in this use case, the SQL database stores intermediate results, other run information, and simulation metrics. Alternatively, Azure Machine Learning can read the data directly from the Data Lake service.

4.  Use Azure Machine Learning to train the model by using data in Azure SQL Database, and deploy the model and service to Kubernetes.

5.  Install the Ray framework on the same Kubernetes cluster to parallelize the execution of the scoring script during inferencing. Each execution runs the demand-forecasting module for specified locations and products over a given forecast period. The forecasting results are read by the optimization module, which calculates the optimal inventory levels. Finally, the results are stored in Azure SQL Database.

6.  Power Apps hosts a user interface for business users and analysts to collect parametric information, such as service level, product, and location. Users also use Power Apps to submit the collected parameters and to launch executions of the deployed machine learning module that is hosted in Kubernetes clusters.

7.  Power BI ingests data from Azure SQL Database and allows users to analyze results and perform sensitive analysis. All Power BI dashboards are integrated into Power Apps to have a unified UI for calling the API, reading results, and performing downstream analysis.

### Components

-   [Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/) is a scalable and secure data lake for high-performance analytics workloads. By using Data Lake Storage, you can manage petabytes of data with high throughput. Data Lake Storage can accommodate multiple, heterogeneous sources and data coming in structured, semi-structured, or unstructured formats.

### Alternatives

In this solution, Machine Learning performs forecasting and inventory management analytics. However, you can use [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/databricks/) or Azure Synapse Analytics to perform the same type of analytics when the amount of data is large. For more information about using Azure Synapse Analytics, see [Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-overview).

As an alternative to [mapping data flows](/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-overview) in Azure Data Factory to curate and perform ETL on data in [Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/data-lake/), you can use Azure Databricks for a code-first approach.

Depending on your specific use case and your choice of analytics platform for end users, you can use other relational or storage services, such as Azure Synapse Analytics or [Data Lake Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), instead of storing your data in Azure SQL Server. For example, if the data has accumulated for a long period of time and there's a need to run analytics queries against this data, Azure Synapse analytics is a good option as part of the architecture.

Instead of running the Ray framework on Kubernetes, you can use the Ray framework on a compute instance in Azure Machine Learning to perform inferencing. If you incorporate the Ray framework on Azure Machine Learning, you might find [ray-on-ml](https://github.com/microsoft/ray-on-aml), a package on GitHub, helpful.

You could use [Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) instead of, or along with, Power Apps to create the user interface for access to the Power BI embedded reports.

### Forecasting with Deep Learning

The implemented reference solution uses advanced machine learning and deep learning methods for time-series forecasting. Specifically, this solution uses multivariate probabilistic forecasting to account for uncertainties that are common in supply chains. By using an ensemble modeling approach that blends Deep AutoRegression RNN (DeepAR) or Transformer models that use the classical Monte Carlo Sampling method, the reference solution achieved 99.9% mean square error (MSE) improvement over a customer's initial approach for high-volume/high-impact business products. For ensembling, this solution explored XGBClassifier and XGBRegressor model architectures.
