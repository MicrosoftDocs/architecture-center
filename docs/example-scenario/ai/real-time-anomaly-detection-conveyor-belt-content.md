### Workflow

1. Data source

   A sophisticated data-collection sensor is a crucial Internet of Things (IoT) component. Sensors collect analog data from the physical world and translate it into digital data assets. Sensors can measure just about any aspect of the physical world. The calibration of sensors allows them to be tailored to application-specific functions. In this dataset, sensors are calibrated to accurately measure metrics like temperature and vibrations.
   
   On most factory floors, connected devices run on schedules. Anomaly detection of temperature and vibrations is needed when the connected devices is running. Time Series API is used to capture and relay connected devices status.

1. Ingest

   We recommend [Azure IoT Hub](/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-introduction) for streaming data from IoT sensors and connecting IoT devices. For ingesting data from Time Series API and data orchestration, we recommend [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/introduction).

1. Store
   
   Data collected from IoT sensors (temperature and vibrations) and Time Series API (connected devices status) are all time series. Time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. This data is collected as flat files. Each flat file is tagged with an IoT sensor ID and the date and time of collection and stored in [Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/data-lake).

1. AI / machine learning - data preparation and training

   *Data preparation* is the process of gathering, combining, structuring, and organizing data so it can be used to build machine learning models, business intelligence (BI), and analytics and data visualization applications.
   
   [Azure Databricks](/azure/databricks/scenarios/what-is-azure-databricks) is used to prepare the data before the data is used to build models. Azure Databricks provides an interactive workspace that enables collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. In analytics workflow, Azure Databricks is used to read data from [Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/data-lake) to perform data wrangling and data exploration.

   *Model training* is the process of using a machine learning algorithm to learn patterns based on data and pick a suitable model for making predictions.
 
   [Azure Machine learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) is used to train the model. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service that accelerates and manages the machine learning project lifecycle. The lifecycle includes training, deploying models, and managing machine learning operations (MLOps).

1. AI / machine learning - inference

   *Machine learning inference* is the process of feeding previously unseen data points into a machine learning model to calculate an output, like a numerical score. In this case, it's used to determine whether input data is anomalous.

   The model registry is built into [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning). It's used to store and version models in Azure. The model registry makes it easy to organize and keep track of trained models.

   After a machine learning model is trained, the model needs to be deployed so that newly available data can be fed through it for inferencing. The recommended deployment target is an [Azure managed endpoint](/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints). 

1. Analytical workload

   The results of model scoring are saved back into the analytics systems, in this case [Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/data-lake), where the input data was collected. This helps in sourcing the results to the front end and in model monitoring and retraining.

1. Front-end model consumption

   You can consume the scored results via an app or on the [Power BI](/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) platform. In this scenario, which provides real-time inferencing as soon as anomalies are detected, you can route alerts to stakeholders through custom Microsoft or third-party event management APIs that are hosted in Azure or elsewhere.

## Scenario details

Smart factory floors enable collaborative systems to provide real-time responses to changing conditions and customer demands throughout the supply network.

AI and machine learning are used in unique ways throughout the manufacturing sector. The most impactful of these applications are predictive maintenance and fault prevention. Specifically, detecting anomalies in temperature and vibrations of motors attached to connected devicess reduces maintenance costs, repair and overhaul time, and the need for spare part inventory. It also increases the uptime of the machinery. The introduction of predictive maintenance and fault prevention saves millions of dollars a year, and in some cases saves lives by removing personnel from dangerous situations.

You can achieve predictive maintenance in several ways, including rule-based, supervised, and unsupervised machine learning. Rule-based machine learning requires known threshold levels. When labels are available for anomalies, supervised machine learning is the most viable option. If no labels are available for the detection of anomalous behavior, unsupervised anomaly detection is the best method. Whatever the methodology, the model's outcome is to predict whether the incoming data is anomalous.

Because sensors capture data in real time, anomaly detection should be able to detect anomalies immediately. You can address potential risks that would otherwise go undetected before they escalate.

### Sample Sensor metrics temperature, vibration and connected device status data

The data necessary to predictively maintain motors attached to connected devices are temperature, vibrations, and connected devices status. Sample data is presented here.

**connected device status:** On most factory floors, generally, connected devices are run on specific schedules. Anomaly detection of temperature and vibration is needed when the connected device is running. A conveyer belt value of zero indicates that the connected device is inactive. A value of one means it's active. This sample graph shows how connected device status is recorded:

:::image type="content" source="media/conveyor-belt-status.png" alt-text="Graph that shows connected device status data." lightbox="media/conveyor-belt-status.png" border="false":::

**Temperature:** Sensors attached to connected devices and the factory floor can record the temperature of the motor and baseline the ambient temperature. Temperature is seasonally affected because of sunlight exposure, air conditioning settings, and numerous other factors. You need to address the seasonal aspect of temperature. There are many ways to do so. One method, if we take motor temperature as an example, is to subtract the baseline ambient temperature of the factory floor from the motor temperature:

*(Adjusted Temperature = Motor Temperature - Ambient Temperature)*

 This sample graph shows temperatures recorded from motors and the ambient baseline temperature:

:::image type="content" source="media/motor-ambient-baseline-temperatures.png" alt-text="Graph that shows temperatures recorded from motors and the ambient baseline temperature." lightbox="media/motor-ambient-baseline-temperatures.png" border="false":::


The following sample graph shows how the temperature from a connected device motor is adjusted for seasonality by using the ambient temperature of the factory floor. It also shows anomalies, in red, that are detected by a model that uses the architecture suggested in this article.

:::image type="content" source="media/temperatures-adjusted-anomalies.png" alt-text="Graph that shows how temperatures are adjusted for seasonality. It also shows anomalies." lightbox="media/temperatures-adjusted-anomalies.png" border="false":::

**Vibrations:** Sensors collect vibrations as RMS (root mean square) of the half sinusoidal wave. Because RMS represents the area and not the peak value, you need to convert RMS to peak before you test for anomalies. This sample graph shows how vibration peak data is collected by a sensor that's attached to a motor:

This sample graph shows vibration anomalies, in red, that are detected by a model that uses the architecture suggested in this article:

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

The components in this architecture provide high availability. However, machine learning and analytics tasks are made up of two parts: training and production deployment.

Resources required for training don't typically require high availability. For production deployment, high availability is fully supported by [Azure Machine Learning endpoints](/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints).

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

This scenario provides improved security that's built into the components. It also provides permissions that you can manage via Microsoft Entra authentication or role-based access control. Consider the following [Azure Machine Learning best practices for enterprise security](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-enterprise-security) to establish suitable security levels.

Manage security for and access to the IoT hub that interacts with the IoT sensors by following the baseline guidance in [Azure security baseline for Azure IoT Hub](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/iot-hub-security-baseline).
