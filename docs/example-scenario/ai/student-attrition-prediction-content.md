### Dataflow

1. **Data source**. Educational data comes from various sources:

   - District records
   - Digital archives of instructional materials and grade books
   - Detailed information about financial grants
   - Student responses to course surveys

   Educational data is retrieved from various data sources, including district databases and state databases. It's housed in an on-premises database.

1. **Data preparation**. During data preparation, the data is gathered, combined, structured, and organized. It's then ready to be used:

   - To build machine learning models.
   - For business intelligence purposes.
   - In analytics and data visualization applications.

   The solution uses Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the process of transforming and loading the data. It uses Azure Synapse Analytics to process data and to trigger Machine Learning experiments.

1. **AI machine learning training**. The solution uses Azure Machine Learning studio to train a wide range of supervised learning algorithms and to find a model that accurately predicts student attrition. The following Responsible AI Toolbox tools help to implement responsible AI:

   - The interactive interpretability dashboard helps users understand the major factors that contribute to student attrition.
   - The fairness tool provides an interactive dashboard for detecting and mitigating bias that's related to student gender and race in the chosen model.

1. **AI machine learning inferencing**. During inferencing, previously unseen data points are fed into a machine learning model. The model calculates the probability of student attrition. In Machine Learning, a built-in model registry stores and provides version control for models in the Azure cloud. The model registry makes it easy to organize and keep track of trained models. Trained models are deployed to instances of Azure Data Science Virtual Machine or managed endpoints.

1. **Analytical workload**. The model scoring results are stored in Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure SQL Database. The results are then available for use in the front end and for monitoring and retraining the models.

1. **Front-end model consumption**. Power BI and the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service consume the scored results.

## Scenario details

Student attrition is one of the most common challenges faced by educational institutions across the globe. Attrition is prevalent at all levels of both private and public education systems, leading to various consequences. For example, in the public system, student attrition results in ineffective use of tax revenue. At private institutions, attrition damages reputations and negatively affects school revenue. When student attrition levels are elevated, fewer graduating professionals enter the workforce, which threatens the global economy.

Given these consequences, educational institutions are heavily investing in ways to reduce student attrition. It has become increasingly important for these institutions to identify and address the root causes of attrition. Understanding the major contributing factors helps institutions support individual students and implement at-scale solutions to reduce attrition rates. Institutions also must be able to predict attrition rates to minimize attrition across a broad set of program offerings.

Predicting student attrition is a binary classification problem that predicts whether a student will leave school. This type of model is built on student-centric data that includes demographic data, financial data, the student's academic history, and the course delivery mode.

For interpretability and bias detection, this solution uses the Responsible AI Toolbox. When educational institutions understand the factors that impact continuous education, they can take appropriate actions to curtail student attrition. But institutions need to use models with no bias toward protected classes like gender and race. This point is important, as is the need to consider and implement responsible AI practices. Equitable models help provide unbiased support for student success.

### Potential use cases

This solution applies to many areas:

- Adaptive learning. In education, adaptive learning is crucial for student success. After taking into account an individual student's progress, educational institutions can support educators and customize approaches to provide the best possible learning experience for the student.
- Employee attrition prediction. Employees are valuable assets of any organization. It's important to know whether employees are dissatisfied, or whether there are other reasons employees might leave their jobs. When employers have this information, they can take proactive measures to retain employees.
- Customer churn prediction. In retail, churn prediction helps identify whether users are likely to stop using a website, service, or product. Companies and large corporations suffer losses when they can't retain customers. The customer churn model helps these organizations identify ways to improve their offerings and prevent customers from leaving them.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

The technologies in this solution were chosen for their scalability and availability, with the aim of managing and controlling the costs.

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

The components in this solution feature high availability. But there are two parts to machine learning and analytics tasks: training and production deployment. Resources that are required for training don't typically need high availability. As for production deployment, Azure VMs fully support high availability. For detailed information, see [Availability options for Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/availability).

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

The components in this solution offer built-in security. They also support permissions that you can manage by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication or role-based access control. For information about establishing suitable enterprise-level security, see [Azure Machine Learning best practices for enterprise security](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-enterprise-security).

Azure Synapse Analytics features enterprise-grade and industry-leading security that uses component isolation to protect data, secure networks, and boost threat protection. Component isolation can minimize exposure to threats during security attacks. Azure Synapse Analytics also offers data obfuscation to protect sensitive personal student data.

SQL Database provides security capabilities at all levels, from data protection and data masking to threat protection. For more information, see [An overview of Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance security capabilities](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview?view=azuresql).

When you implement security features in this solution, consider guidelines in the following resources:

### Cost optimization

One aspect of cost optimization is looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information about creating a cost-effective workload, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

- To optimize costs by paying only for what you need, scale resources according to your analytics, training, and deployment workloads.
- To estimate the cost of implementing this solution, use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).
- For information about various licenses that Power BI offers, see [Power BI pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing).

### Performance efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

You can scale most components in this scenario up or down depending on the analysis activity levels. Azure Synapse Analytics provides scalability and high performance. At low activity levels, you can pause this service or scale back computing resources.

You can scale Machine Learning according to the size of your data and the compute resources that you need for model training. For deployment, you can scale compute resources based on your expected load, scoring service, and latency requirements with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

For guidance about designing scalable solutions, see [Performance efficiency checklist](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/performance-efficiency).

### Other considerations

Follow MLOps guidelines to standardize and manage an end-to-end machine learning lifecycle that's scalable across multiple workspaces. Before you go into production, ensure that the implemented solution supports ongoing inference with retraining cycles and the automated redeployment of models. For more information, see the following resources:

- [Unifying machine learning operations in Azure](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CS_AzureDataAI/SitePages/Mlops.aspx)
- [Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2)

As part of Machine Learning, responsible AI is based on the six pillars of AI use and development:

- Fairness
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability
