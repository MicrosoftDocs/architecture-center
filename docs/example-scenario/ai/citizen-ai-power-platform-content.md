### Workflow

**1 - Ingest:** Use [Azure Synapse pipelines](/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) to pull batch data from various sources, both on-premises and in the cloud. This is a Lambda Architecture with two data ingestion flows (streaming and batch).

- **Streaming**: The streaming data flows are presented at the top of the architecture diagram (e.g., Big data streams and IoT Devices).
  - You can use [Azure Event Hubs or Azure IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs) to ingest data streams generated by client applications or IoT devices. Event Hubs or IoT Hub ingests and stores streaming data, preserving the sequence of events received. Consumers can connect to hub endpoints to retrieve messages for processing.
- **Batch**: At the lower half of this architecture, there is a variety of data being ingested and processed in batches such as:
  - Unstructured data (e.g. video, images, audio, free text)
  - Semi-structured data (e.g. json, xml, csv, logs)
  - Structured data (e.g. relational databases, Azure Data Services)
  
    [Azure Synapse Link](/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link) creates a tight, seamless integration between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics.
    [Azure Synapse Pipelines](/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities?tabs=data-factory) can be triggered based on a pre-defined schedule or in response to an event. They can also be invoked by calling REST APIs.

**2 - Store:** Ingested data can be landed directly in raw format and then transformed on the [Azure Data Lake](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction). Once curated and transformed into relational structures, data can be presented for consumption in [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics).

**3,4 - Train and deploy model:** [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) provides an enterprise-grade ML service for building and deploying models faster. It provides users at all skill levels with a low-code designer, automated ML, and a hosted Jupyter Notebook environment. Models can be deployed either as real-time endpoints on [Azure Kubernetes Service or as a Machine Learning managed endpoint](/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints). For batch inferencing of ML models, you can use [Machine Learning pipelines](/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines).

**5,6 - Consume:** A model—either batch or real-time—published in Machine Learning can generate a REST endpoint that can be consumed in a [custom application built using the low-code Power Apps platform](/connectors/custom-connectors/use-custom-connector-powerapps). You can also call a [real-time Machine Learning endpoint from a Power BI report](/power-bi/connect-data/service-aml-integrate) to present predictions in business reports.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the Machine Learning and Power Platform stack have a range of built-in connectors to help ingest data directly. These may be useful for a one-off minimum viable product (MVP). However, the **Ingest** and **Store** sections of the architecture advise on the role of standardized data pipelines for the sourcing and storage of data from different sources at scale – patterns that are typically implemented and maintained by the enterprise data platform teams.

### Alternatives

An ML minimum viable product (MVP) benefits from speed to outcome. In some cases, the needs of a custom model can be met by pre-trained [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services) or [Azure Applied AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/applied-ai-services). In others, [Power Apps AI Builder](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder) may provide a fit-for-purpose model.

## Scenario details

A general technology trend is the growing popularity of citizen AI roles. Such roles are business practitioners looking to improve business processes by applying machine learning (ML) and AI technologies. The growing maturity and availability of low-code tools to develop ML models significantly contribute to this trend.

With a well-known high failure rate for such initiatives, the ability to rapidly prototype and validate an AI application in a real-world setting becomes a key enabler to a fail-fast approach. There are two critical tools for developing models that modernize processes and drive transformative outcomes:

- **An ML toolkit for all skill levels**
  - Supports no-code to fully-coded ML development
  - Has a flexible, low-code GUI
  - Enables users to source rapidly and prep data
  - Enables users to build and deploy models rapidly
  - Has advanced, automated ML capabilities for ML algorithm development
- **A low-code application development toolkit**
  - Enables users to build custom applications and automation workflows
  - Creates workflows so that consumers and business processes can interact with an ML model

[Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) fulfils the role of a low-code GUI for ML development. It has automated ML and deployment to batch or real-time endpoints. [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com), which includes [Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com) and [Microsoft Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com), provides the toolkits to rapidly build a custom application and workflow that implements your ML algorithm. End business users can now build production-grade ML applications to transform legacy business processes.

### Potential use cases

These toolkits minimize the time and effort needed to prototype the benefits of an ML model on a business process. You can easily extend a prototype to a production-grade application. The uses for these techniques include:

- **Manufacturing Ops with legacy applications that use outdated deterministic predictions.** Such situations can benefit from the improved accuracy of an ML model. Improving accuracy requires both a model and development effort to integrate with legacy systems on-premises.
- **Call Center Ops with legacy applications that don't adjust when [data drifts](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-datasets?tabs=python).** Models that automatically retrain may significantly improve churn prediction or risk profiling accuracy. Validation requires integration with existing customer relationship management and ticket management systems, which could prove expensive.

## Considerations

You're not done when you use these services to create a proof of concept or MVP. There's more work to make a production solution. Frameworks such as the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework) provide reference guidance and best practices to apply to your architecture.

### Availability

Most of the components used in this example scenario are managed services that will automatically scale. The [availability of the services](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=machine-learning-service%2Cvirtual-machines&regions=all) used in this example varies by region.

Apps based on ML typically require one set of resources for training and another for serving. Resources required for training generally don't need high availability, as live production requests don't directly hit these resources. Resources required for serving requests need high availability.

### DevOps

DevOps practices are used to orchestrate the end-to-end approach used in this example. If your organization is new to DevOps, the [DevOps Checklist](/azure/architecture/checklist/dev-ops) can help you get started.

The [Machine Learning DevOps Guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-mlops#machine-learning-devops-mlops-best-practices-with-azure-machine-learning) presents best practices and learnings on adopting ML operations (MLOps) in the enterprise with Machine Learning.

DevOps automation can be applied to the Power Platform solution provided in this example. For more information about Power Platform DevOps, see [Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps - Power Platform](/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools).

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is looking at reducing unnecessary expenses and improving operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

**Azure pricing:** First-party Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services on Azure use a consumption-based pricing model. They don't require a license or subscription fee. Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs. See [Cost Optimization](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/index) in the Well-Architected Framework for other considerations.

**Power Platform pricing:** [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing), [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) are software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and have their pricing models, including per app plan, and user.

## Deploy this scenario

Consider this business scenario: a field agent uses an app that estimates a car's market price. You can use Machine Learning to prototype this app's ML model quickly. You use a low-code designer and ML features to create the model and then deploy it as a real-time REST endpoint.

The model may prove the concept, but a user cannot consume a model implemented as a REST API. Power Platform can help close this last mile, as represented below.

:::image type="content" source="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-rest-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an ML model that's created in Machine Learning. The model obtains car data from Azure Data Lake, and it provides inferences to an endpoint." lightbox="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-rest-ui.png" :::

Here's a user interface for the app, created in Power Apps using the low-code interface that Power Apps provides.

:::image type="content" source="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-car-price.png" alt-text="A UI screenshot that shows various controls, such as buttons and drop-down lists, for the user to enter car data. The app predicts a price and displays it when the user selects the Predict button." lightbox="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-car-price.png" :::

You can use Power Automate to build a low-code workflow to parse the user's input, pass it to the Machine Learning endpoint, and retrieve the prediction. You can also use [Power BI to interact with the Machine Learning model](/power-bi/connect-data/service-aml-integrate) and create custom business reports and dashboards.

:::image type="content" source="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-dashboard.png" alt-text="Architecture showing schematic of the workflow." lightbox="media/citizen-ai-power-platform-dashboard.png" :::

To deploy this end-to-end example, follow [step-by-step instructions using this sample Power App](https://github.com/Azure/carprice-aml-powerapp).

## Extended scenarios

### Deploy to Microsoft Teams

The sample app provided in the example above can also be deployed to Microsoft Teams. Teams provide a great distribution channel for your apps and provide your users with a collaborative app experience. For more information about deploying Power Apps to Teams, see [Publish your app using Power Apps app in Teams - Power Apps](/powerapps/teams/publish-and-share-apps).

### Consume the API from multiple apps and automation

In this example, we configure a Power Automate cloud flow to consume the REST endpoint as an HTTP action. We can instead set up a custom connector for the REST endpoint and consume it directly from Power Apps or Power Automate. This approach is practical when we want multiple apps to consume the same endpoint. It also provides governance by using the connector DLP policy in the Power Platform admin center. To create a custom connector, see [Use a custom connector from a Power Apps app](/connectors/custom-connectors/use-custom-connector-powerapps). For more information on Power Platform connector DLP, see [Data loss prevention policies - Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention).
