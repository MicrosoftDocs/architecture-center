This article compares using [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-central) versus individual Azure platform-as-a-service (PaaS) components for building, deploying, and managing internet-of-things (IoT) solutions.

IoT solutions use a combination of technologies to connect devices, events, and actions through cloud applications. The technologies and services you choose depend on your scenario's development, deployment, and management requirements.

The IoT Central application platform-as-a-service (aPaaS) already provides the integrated Azure components and capabilities that an IoT solution needs. Another option is to combine [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub) with other Azure PaaS components to develop your own IoT solutions.

## Start with Azure IoT Central

IoT Central is a Microsoft aPaaS that assembles Azure PaaS components into an extensible, fully managed IoT app development and operations platform. IoT Central accelerates solution development, streamlines operations, and simplifies building reliable, scalable, and secure IoT solutions.

IoT Central offers:

- An out-of-the-box web user experience (UX) and API surface area that simplifies device management and rule creation.
- Extension of IoT intelligence into line-of-business applications to help act on insights.
- Built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global availability, and a predictable cost structure.

The following diagram shows an IoT Central-based architecture:

IoT Central ingests device events and telemetry through the [Azure IoT device SDKs](/azure/iot-develop/about-iot-sdks), [Azure RTOS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/rtos), [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sphere), or [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge).

1. IoT Central is built with multiple Azure PaaS services, so it provides the following capabilities out of the box:
   - Data ingestion and provisioning services.
   - Hot, warm, and cold path data storage and analytics.
   - A managed PaaS layer that delivers High Availability/Disaster Recovery (HADR) and elastic scaling.
   - A management web user experience that lets you:
     - Manage devices with raw data view, connectivity status, device modeling, and jobs.
     - View and analyze device data with dashboards, analytics, and rules.
     - Secure data and devices with user management and organizations.

1. IoT Central extends solutions by triggering alerts, exporting data, and supporting data queries.

1. IoT Central integrates with line-of-business apps like Power BI, Azure Maps, Search, API Management, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Dynamics 365, Flow, or Logic Apps.

## Build with Azure PaaS services

If you need more control and customization, you can use individual Azure PaaS components to build an IoT solution. The following diagram shows Azure services in a PaaS-based IoT architecture:

[ ![Diagram showing a reference architecture composed of Azure PaaS services.](./media/azure-iot-architecture.png) ](./media/azure-iot-architecture.png#lightbox)

1. IoT systems can ingest device data through the Azure IoT device SDKs, Azure RTOS, Azure Sphere, or Azure IoT Edge.

1. IoT Hub, [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](/azure/iot-dps), or [Azure Digital Twins](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/digital-twins) can provide device provisioning, connectivity, and management.

1. For data storage and analytics:

   - The hot path can be through [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics) or [Azure HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight).
   - The warm path can be through [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-explorer).
   - The cold path can be through [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database) or [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db).

1. Management and business integration services can include Power BI, Azure Maps, Search, API Management, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Dynamics 365, Flow, and Logic Apps.

## Compare aPaas and PaaS approaches

IoT Central lets you avoid maintaining and updating a complex and evolving IoT infrastructure. You can focus time and money on transforming your business and designing innovative offerings.

If your solution requires customized features or services that IoT Central doesn't support, you can develop a PaaS solution with IoT Hub as a core element.

The following comparison tables and links can help you decide whether to use an IoT Central managed solution or build a PaaS solution with IoT Hub.

### IoT Central vs. IoT Hub-based PaaS solution

The following table describes how IoT Central or an IoT Hub-based PaaS solution achieve various IoT features and capabilities.

| Feature | IoT Central | IoT Hub-based PaaS |
