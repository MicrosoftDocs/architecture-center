### Dataflow

1. The environment can use these and other communication protocols:

   - Building Automation Controls network (BACnet)
   - Modbus
   - KNX
   - LonWorks

1. On-premises devices and systems send telemetry and other data to the cloud. Data sources include:

   - Brownfield devices
   - Direct-connect sensors
   - Sensors that independent software vendors (ISVs) provide
   - Existing business systems

1. Devices, sensors, and actuators generate telemetry. Some devices interact directly with IoT Hub. Other devices send data to IoT Hub through Azure IoT Edge.

1. External, batch, or legacy systems send data to Azure Data Factory. This static data typically originates in files and databases.

1. Business-to-business connectors translate vendor data and stream it to Azure Digital Twins.

1. IoT Hub ingests device telemetry. IoT Hub also provides these services:

   - Device-level security
   - Device provisioning services
   - Device twins
   - Command and control services
   - Scale-out capabilities

1. Data Factory transforms semi-static data and transfers it to Azure Data Explorer or to long-term storage.

1. Azure Functions receives the IoT Hub data and uses [Azure Digital Twins APIs][Ingest IoT Hub telemetry into Azure Digital Twins] to update Azure Digital Twins. Azure Digital Twins holds the spatial graph of the buildings and environment. Azure Digital Twins models the environment with [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)][Digital Twins Definition Language]. [Azure Functions][Azure Functions] processes the data, performing fault detection and graph updates.

1. Various components create, store, and load DTDL models.

1. Azure Digital Twins sends the data through Azure Event Grid to Azure Data Explorer. This analytics service functions as a historian by storing the solution's time series data.

1. Simulation engines and AI tools process the data. Examples include Azure Cognitive Services, AI models, and partner simulation services.

1. Azure Data Lake provides long-term storage for the data. Azure Synapse Analytics analyzes and reports on the data.

1. For visualization tools and enterprise apps, the solution access layer provides secure access to core system services:

   - Azure API Management offers functionality for normalizing, securing, and customizing APIs. This platform also enforces usage quotas and rate limits.
   - Azure SignalR Service sends notifications to UIs when telemetry and data changes.
   - For applications that exchange data asynchronously or at volume, various components provide publishing and subscribing mechanisms:

     - IoT Hub
     - Azure Service Bus queues
     - Azure Event Hubs
     - Web hooks

1. Service applications collect data from the access control API layer. These applications then analyze and prepare the data for end-user applications. Microsoft tools like Power Apps, Power BI, and Azure Maps create reports and insights on data in the Azure data stores.

1. Enterprise applications use the prepared data. Examples include:

   - Dynamics 365 modules.
   - ISV solutions.
   - Microsoft Teams apps.
   - Field-optimized solutions such as mobile apps and wearables:

     - [HoloLens][HoloLens]
     - [RealWear HMT][RealWear HMT]

## Solution details

*Smart places* are physical environments that bring together connected devices and data sources. By using these environments, you can see and control:

- Products and systems.
- Interior and exterior spaces.
- Personal experiences with surroundings.

Smart places can include buildings, college campuses, corporate campuses, stadiums, and cities. These environments provide value by helping property owners, facility managers, and occupants operate and maintain sites. Smart places also make spaces more efficient, cost effective, comfortable, and productive.

Smart spaces digitally model spaces and compile relevant data. From that data, you can derive insights on how people, places, and devices are connected.

### Potential use cases

This solution applies to many areas:

- Smart campuses (education industry)
- Facilities management (real estate)
- Smart offices
- Energy optimization

### Business outcomes

In this example solution, a large commercial real estate owner is digitally transforming an office property. This improvement combines legacy facilities-management data with new features and technologies including:

- Occupancy sensing.
- Cafe queue optimization.
- Parking.
- Shuttle services.

This effort requires integrating brownfield devices and modern Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor the physical space. The brownfield devices communicate through common building transports such as BACnet and Modbus.

The company's goals include:

- Optimizing energy usage by diagnosing faults and streamlining field service management. This optimization integrates the existing building management system with devices.

- Deriving new spatial insights and offering innovative occupant experiences by connecting modern devices.

- Developing a cohesive digital model of the environment by bringing together multiple sources of data. The model should expand data analysis opportunities.

- Creating a scalable solution that can collect and archive millions of data points.

- Building a solution that can easily add partner solutions. The solution should also incorporate partner data into the environment's digital twin.

## Considerations

The following considerations apply to this solution.

### Reliability

#### Scalability

Solutions for smart places solutions can be relatively simple, low-volume implementations. They can also be sophisticated implementations that handle a high volume of data. A solution that aggregates heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) telemetry across a large campus is an example of a high-volume implementation.

The core Azure services in this solution are scalable by design and well suited for complex solutions. But when you combine these services, ensure that they don't create choke points. Early in the development cycle, run performance tests at scheduled intervals to identify potential problems.

#### Flexibility

Design your smart space to be well integrated but also flexible. Smart places use cases are rapidly evolving. At some point after you deploy your solution, you'll need to add new sensors, data types, AI functionality, and visualization techniques. To increase flexibility:

- Choose a loosely coupled solution like the proposed architecture.
- Use [industry standards for data ontology][Adopting an industry ontology]. This approach helps reduce the time needed to add new functionality and integrate new software.
- Use [API Management][API Management - overview]. This platform provides a way to create multiple API styles and signatures for a single underlying API.

### Security

Legacy building solutions often rely on a lack of external connectivity as their primary source of security. But even data that doesn't identify people can provide information about a business or the people in a building. For instance, organizations use cameras to count people, track assets, and provide security data.

Be careful where you process and save images. Ensure that you address all customer requirements, including privacy issues. Make security a priority throughout the data life cycle of your smart space solution. Specifically, be aware of what data you collect, where you process and store it, and what conclusions you draw from it.

### Cost optimization

Use the [Azure pricing calculator][Azure pricing calculator] to estimate the cost of an IoT solution.

- For other cost considerations, see [Principles of cost optimization][Principles of cost optimization] in the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework documentation.
- For a discussion about optimizing the cost of services that IoT solutions commonly use, see [Azure IoT Reference Architecture][Azure IoT reference architecture].
