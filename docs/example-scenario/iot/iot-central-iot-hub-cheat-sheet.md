# Choose an Internet of Things (IoT) solution in Azure

IoT solutions require a combination of technologies to effectively connect
events, devices, and actions to cloud applications. In Azure, you have many
options for building and deploying your IoT solutions, and which technologies
and services you’ll use depends on your scenario’s development, deployment, and
management needs.

Using a hosted software as a service (SaaS) platform streamlines many of the
complex decisions you’ll face when building an IoT solution. Azure IoT Central
provides a hosted, extensible, fully managed app development platform that
reduces the burden and cost of building and managing IoT solutions. It’s built
on existing Azure services, and takes much of the guesswork and complexity out
of building reliable, scalable, and secure IoT applications.

The easy-to-use Azure IoT Central interface makes it simple to monitor device
conditions, create rules, and manage millions of devices and their data remotely
throughout their life cycles. Furthermore, it enables you to act on device
insights by extending IoT intelligence into line-of-business applications. Azure
IoT Central also offers built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global
availability, and a predictable cost structure.

However, in certain scenarios you may need a higher degree of control and
customization than Azure IoT Central provides. In these cases, Azure also offers
individual platform as a service (PaaS) cloud services that you can use to build
a custom IoT solution. For example, you might build a solution using a
combination of these PaaS services:

-   Azure IoT Hub for device connectivity and management

-   Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service for automated device provisioning
    to IoT Hub in your solution at scale

-   Azure Time Series Insights for storing and analyzing warm and cold path time
    series data from IoT devices

-   Azure Stream Analytics for analyzing hot path data from IoT devices

-   Azure IoT Edge for running AI, third-party services, or your own business
    logic on IoT edge devices

>   Choosing to build with Azure IoT Central gives you the opportunity to focus
>   time and money on transforming your business and designing innovative
>   offerings, rather than maintaining and updating a complex and continually
>   evolving IoT infrastructure. However, if your solution requires features or
>   services that Azure IoT Central does not currently support, you may need to
>   develop a PaaS solution using Azure IoT Hub as a core element.

## Comparing Azure IoT Central and Azure IoT Hub

You can use the table and links below to help decide if you can use a managed
solution based on Azure IoT Central, or if you should consider building a PaaS
solution using Azure IoT Hub.
