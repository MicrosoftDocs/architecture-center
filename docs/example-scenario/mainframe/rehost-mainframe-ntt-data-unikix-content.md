Components include middleware, monitoring systems, applications, and data." lightbox="media/rehost-mainframe-ntt-data-unikix-original-architecture.png" border="false":::

### Workflow

- On-premises users interact with the mainframe by using TCP/IP (**A**):

  - Admin users interact through a TN3270 terminal emulator.
  - Web interface users interact via a web browser over TLS 1.3 port 443.

- Mainframes use communication protocols such as LU 6.2, TN3270, FTP, Sockets, and UTS to receive input (**B**).

- Batch and online applications process the input (**C**).

- Mainframe applications are in COBOL, PL/I, Assembler, 4GL, and Fortran. These languages and compatible ones run in an enabled environment (**D**).

- Mainframes use hierarchical, network, and relational databases (**E**).

- Services perform tasks for the applications. Services that typically run include program execution, I/O operations, error detection, and protection. (**F**).

- Middleware and utility services manage tasks like tape storage, queueing, output, and web support (**G**).

- Operating systems provide an interface between the engine and the software that it runs (**H**).

- Partitions run separate workloads or segregate work types within the environment (**I**).

## Azure architecture

### Workflow

1. ExpressRoute connects an on-premises corporate network to NTT DATA's UniKix mainframe rehosting software suite. Traffic from users and external interfaces that aren't on the Azure platform flows through this ExpressRoute connection to the Azure instances.

1. Azure Load Balancer distributes online transactions across two or more Azure virtual machines (VMs). Port 4444 is used to connect with x3270. For a single-host alternative, see [Alternatives](#alternatives).

1. The application server runs the following NTT DATA products:

   - TPE. This environment runs:

     - Rehosted online IBM CICS transactions.
     - IBM IMS/TM applications.
     - Transformed IDMS DC programs.
     - Related resources.

     These workloads run on industry-standard servers and operating systems such as Red Hat Linux.

   - BPE. This environment provides a complete job entry subsystem (JES) environment for the administration, execution, and management of batch workloads.

   - UniKix Secure, which was previously known as Transaction Security Facility (TSF). This external security manager provides role-based access control that's based on security for online TPE-based transactions.

   - NTT DATA COBOL. This technology produces optimized, portable object code that you can deploy in Azure. NTT DATA COBOL supports ANSI-85 standard and legacy COBOL dialects.

   - NTT DATA VDSO. This mechanism provides a way to store VSAM key-sequenced dataset (KSDS) data in a SQL database rather than local disk files. NTT DATA VDSO supports many database technologies such as SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, and MySQL.

1. Azure managed disks provide storage for shared files.

1. UniKix Secure uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide authentication. This security manager replaces security systems like Resource Access Control Facility (RACF), Access Control Facility 2 (ACF2), and Top Secret.

1. The solution stores database tables and, optionally, VSAM files, in Azure SQL Database. This data is replicated to another Azure region for disaster recovery purposes.

1. Site Recovery replicates the Azure production application VMs. This replication helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages.

1. The second Azure region mirrors the configuration of the primary Azure region for disaster recovery.
  
### Components

- [ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute) extends on-premises networks into Azure over a private, dedicated fiber connection from a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute establishes connections to Microsoft cloud services like Azure and Microsoft 365.

- [Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer) distributes incoming traffic to compute resource clusters. You can define rules and other criteria to distribute the traffic.

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) offers many sizes and types of on-demand, scalable computing resources. With Azure VMs, you get the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain physical hardware.

- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/storage) offers scalable, secure cloud storage for all your data, applications, and workloads:

  - [Azure Disk Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/disks) is high-performance, durable block storage for business-critical applications. Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure on Azure VMs. The available types of disks are Ultra Disk Storage, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD. This solution uses either Premium SSD or Ultra Disk Storage.
  - [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files) offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Cloud and on-premises Windows, Linux, and macOS deployments can mount Azure Files file shares concurrently.
  - [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs) provides scalable and secure object storage. It can manage large amounts of unstructured data, such as archives and data lakes. Blob Storage is a good fit for high-performance computing, machine learning, and cloud-native workloads.

- [Azure databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/databases) offer a choice of fully managed relational and NoSQL databases to fit modern application needs. Automated infrastructure management provides scalability, availability, and security.

- [SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database) is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine. SQL Database runs on the latest stable version of SQL Server and a patched operating system. Automated functionality includes upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring. Because SQL Database offers built-in PaaS capabilities, you can focus on domain-specific, business-critical database administration and optimization.

- [Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery) mirrors Azure VMs to a secondary Azure region. If the primary datacenter fails, the secondary region provides quick failover and disaster recovery.

### Alternatives

- Sometimes scaling isn't possible, due to licensing constraints or your application's design. In those cases, you can mirror the mainframe setup with a single host.
- For disaster recovery, the solution replicates the SQL Server data to another region. As another option, you can use the Always On availability groups feature of SQL Server as a disaster recovery solution.
- In some scenarios, some of the solution's components and workflows are optional or interchangeable.

## Considerations

The following considerations, based on the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/), apply to this solution:

### Reliability

The solution uses Site Recovery to mirror Azure VMs to a secondary Azure region. If the primary datacenter fails, the secondary region provides quick failover and disaster recovery.

### Security

This solution uses an Azure network security group to manage traffic between Azure resources. For more information, see [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

### Cost optimization

- Azure provides cost optimization by running on VMs. You can turn off the VMs when not in use, and script a schedule for known usage patterns. For more information about cost optimization for [VM instances](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/optimize-vm), see the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/).

- For managed disks, the VMs in this solution use either Premium SSD or Ultra Disk Storage. For more information about disk options and pricing, see [Managed disks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks).
