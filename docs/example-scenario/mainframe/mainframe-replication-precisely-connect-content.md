### Workflow

1. A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
2. For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
3. For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
4. The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
5. The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
6. The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
7. The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
8. The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

#### Data integrators

- [Precisely Connect](https://www.precisely.com/product/precisely-connect/connect) can integrate data from multiple sources and provide real-time replication to Azure. You can use it to replicate data without making changes to your application. Connect can also improve the performance of extract, transform, load (ETL) jobs.
- [Azure Databricks](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-databricks-security) is based on Apache Spark and integrates with open-source libraries. It provides a unified platform for running analytics workloads. You can use Python, Scala, R, and SQL languages to frame ETL pipelines and orchestrate jobs.
- [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/event-hubs) is a real-time ingestion service that can process millions of records per second. You can ingest data from multiple sources and use it for real-time analytics. You can easily scale Event Hubs based on the volume of data.

## Scenario details

 You can use various strategies to migrate mainframe and midrange systems to Azure. Data migration plays a key role in this process. In a hybrid cloud architecture, data needs to be replicated between mainframe or midrange systems and the Azure data platform. To maintain the integrity of the data, you need real-time replication for business-critical applications. Precisely Connect can help you replicate data from mainframe and midrange data sources to the Azure data platform in real time by using change data capture (CDC) or by using batch ingestion.

Precisely Connect supports various mainframe and midrange data sources, including Db2 z/OS, Db2 LUW, Db2 for i, IMS, VSAM, files, and copybooks. It migrates them to Azure targets, like SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Azure Synapse Analytics, without affecting applications. It also supports scalability based on data volume and customer requirements. It replicates data without affecting performance or straining the network.

### Potential use cases

This solution applies to the following scenarios:

- Data replication from mainframe and midrange data sources to the Azure data platform.
- In a hybrid cloud architecture, data sync between mainframe or midrange systems and the Azure data platform.
- Near real-time analytics on Azure, based on operational data from mainframe or midrange systems.
- Migration of data from mainframe or midrange systems to Azure without affecting applications.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist).

Use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) and [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to monitor your data migration. Set up alerts for proactive management. For more information about reliability in Azure, see [Designing reliable Azure applications](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/app-design).

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

- Replicating data to Azure and processing it in Azure services can be more cost effective than maintaining it in a mainframe system.
- The Cost Management tool in the Azure portal provides a cost analysis view that can help you analyze your spending.
- You can use Azure Databricks to resize your cluster with autoscaling to optimize costs. Doing so can be less expensive than using a fixed configuration.
- Azure Advisor provides recommendations to optimize performance and cost management.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the cost of implementing this solution.

### Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Performance Efficiency](/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/checklist).

- Precisely Connect can scale based on the volume of data and optimize data replication.
- The Connect Replicator Engine can distribute data for parallel processing. You can balance distribution based on the ingestion of workloads.
- SQL Database serverless can scale automatically based on the volume of workloads.
- Event Hubs can scale based on throughput units and the number of partitions.
