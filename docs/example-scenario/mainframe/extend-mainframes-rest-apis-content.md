Digital transformation is imperative for any business that wants to stay competitive in today's marketplace. This transformation demands timely access to data and data insights, which drive new business processes and client experiences. However, it can also affect existing applications and data in ways that might be overlooked or misunderstood.

To meet the demand for streamlined access, you can adopt integration approaches that take advantage of REST APIs based on industry standards. This architecture extends mainframe applications to Azure without disruptions or modifications to existing mainframe applications. IBM z/OS Connect is a component of IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack. It provides more reliable and secure connectivity between applications on Azure and applications and data on z/OS. IBM z/OS Connect helps integrate and provide access to the data and services on the mainframe.

### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the previous diagram.

To create and deploy APIs for mainframe applications by using a contract-first approach, do the following steps:

1. Import an OpenAPI v3 (OAS3) declarative JSON API schema file into the [z/OS Connect Designer](https://www.ibm.com/docs/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2023.4?topic=concepts-what-is-zos-connect-designer).

1. Use the z/OS Connect Designer to [map your API and z/OS assets](https://www.ibm.com/docs/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2023.4?topic=designer-mapping-your-rest-api-operations-zos-assets).
1. Test the functionality of the APIs by interacting with core z/OS applications. Push the mappings into source control management.
1. Build a web archive file, and deploy it in [the z/OS Connect Server image](https://www.ibm.com/docs/zos-connect/3.0.0?topic=zos-connect-server-image).
1. Import the OAS3 specification into [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/api-management/), establish a connection with the z/OS Connect Server, and configure that connection to be a back end in API Management.
1. Enable and enforce API authentication and authorization mechanisms by using Microsoft Entra ID for enhanced security. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization to APIs in API Management](/azure/api-management/authentication-authorization-overview).
1. Microsoft Entra ID is validated from Power Apps.
1. Use Azure monitoring for the application and all components of the solution. For example, you can use Azure alerting for notifications.
1. Use Azure Site Recovery and Azure high availability for all application components in the cloud environment.

To access mainframe applications through Azure, do the following steps:

1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra ID (**step 6**) to get access to client applications. The client applications also communicate with Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and authorization of access to resources.

1. Access client applications, such as Power Apps or a custom web app (**step 7**). These applications access the mainframe applications through REST API access to IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack.

IT staff use Azure tools to monitor the system and implement disaster recovery measures through Site Recovery:

1. Deploy new or enhanced applications (**step 7**) to consume the REST API interfaces that API Management exposes.

1. Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights (**step 8**) to monitor Microsoft Power Platform, application APIs, and security aspects.
1. Use Site Recovery for disaster recovery (**step 9**).
