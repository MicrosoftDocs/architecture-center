### Workflow

1. Mainframe batch processes can be triggered at a scheduled time using an Operation, Planning, and Control (OPC) Scheduler. They can also be triggered by a message placed in a message queue, like a message that announces that a file was created.
1. A mainframe direct-access storage device (DASD) is used to store input and output files; for example, flat files that are required by the application. You can trigger the batch process by creating a file on the DASD storage.
1. The batch process is an execution of a set of jobs, like a job internally running a user or system program to do a specific task. Usually, batch processes are run without user interaction. All batch jobs on a mainframe are executed under the control of a Job Execution System (JES).
1. Programs in batch processes can read/write data from:

    - A file-based database like Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM).
    - A relational database like Db2 or Informix.
    - A non-relational database like Information Management System (IMS).
    - A message queue.

1. The output of the job execution can be monitored through an OPC scheduler or Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS). A System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) in the JES is also used on the mainframe to check job execution status.
1. The management tier provides the following services:

    - Source control, like Endevor or Changeman.
    - Security, like Resource Access Control Facility (RACF). This security provides authentication for running batches, accessing files, and accessing the database.
    - Output management that supports the storage and search of job execution logs.

## Azure architecture

The second diagram shows how you can use Azure services to re-engineer a similar application with added capabilities and flexibility.

### Workflow

1. Use one of the following triggers to start the Azure batch process.

    - Use the **Azure Databricks** job scheduler or **Azure Function** scheduler.
    - Create a recurring batch process task with **Azure Logic Apps**.
    - Use a storage event, like the creation or deletion of a file in **Azure Blob** or **File storage**.
    - Use a message-based trigger, like the arrival of a message on the **Azure Service Bus**.
    - Create an **Azure Data Factory** trigger.

1. Store files migrated from the mainframe by using Azure Blob Storage or Azure Files. Batch processes re-engineered on Azure can read/write data from this storage.
1. Azure provides various services to implement a mainframe batch workload. Select specific services that are based on your business requirements. For example, compute power required, total execution time, the ability to split mainframe batch process into smaller units, and cost sensitivity.

    1. Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform. Jobs can be written in the R, Python, Java, Scala, and Spark SQL languages. It provides a compute environment with fast cluster start times, auto termination, and autoscaling. It has built-in integration with Azure storage like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake storage. Use Azure Databricks if you need to process large amounts of data in a short time. It's also a good choice if you need to run Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workloads.
    2. AKS and Service Fabric provide an infrastructure to implement a service-based application architecture. It might not be cost effective for a single application. You can refactor your mainframe application using Java Spring Boot. The best way to run Spring Boot apps on Azure is to use Azure Spring Apps, a fully managed Spring service. Java developers can use it to easily build and run Spring Boot Microservices on Azure.
    3. You can re-engineer your mainframe batch application using .NET or Java. Batch provides the infrastructure to run this application at scale. It creates and manages a pool of virtual machines (VMs), installs the applications, and then schedules jobs to run on the VMs. There's no cluster or job scheduler software to install, manage, or scale. Write applications in any programming language supported by Windows or Linux.
    4. You can re-engineer short running COBOL or PL/1 batch programs. For these programs, use Azure services like Functions, WebJobs, or Logic Apps.

1. Azure provides various data services to store and retrieve data.

    - You can migrate mainframe relational databases like Db2 and Informix with minimal changes to the Azure relational database offerings' visibility. For example, relational database services like Azure SQL VM, Azure SQL DB, or Azure SQL MI. You can also use any open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like Azure PostgreSQL. The selection of an Azure database depends on the type of workload, cross-database queries, two-phase commit requirements, and many other factors.
    - You can migrate mainframe non-relational databases like IMS, Integrated Data Management System (IDMS), or VSAM to Azure Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB provides fast response times, automatic and instant scalability, and guaranteed speed at any scale. It's a cost-effective option for unpredictable or sporadic workloads of any size or scale. Developers can easily get started without having to plan for or manage capacity.
    - You can use Azure Cache for Redis to speed up a re-engineered application.

1. Applications, the OS, and Azure resources can use agents to send logs and metrics to **Azure Monitor Logs**.

    - **Application Insight** monitors your migrated application. It automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues.
    - **Azure Log Analytics** helps store, index, query, and derive analytics from the log data collected.

    You can use the output of Log Analytics and Application Insights to create alerts and dashboards, or export to external services. You can also use the output to do an action like the scaling of a VM.

1. This tier provides Azure services for source control, security, and output management. These services might consist of Azure DevOps and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Scenario details

Mainframes are primarily used for processing large amounts of data. Batch processing is a way of processing a high volume of transactions that are grouped together, and then making bulk updates against the database. Once triggered, they require minimal to no user interaction. For example, mainframe systems make it possible for banks and other financial institutions to do end-of-quarter processing and produce reports, like quarterly stock or pension statements.

### Potential use cases

This solution is ideal for the finance, insurance, healthcare, and retail industries. Use this architecture to re-engineer mainframe applications on Azure. The architecture works best for:

- Resource-intensive mainframe batch applications.
- Batch applications that need high compute during a certain time, like end of month, quarter, or year.
- Mainframe batch processes that are repetitive and not resource-intensive but might need utilization by external systems.

## Considerations

### Availability

- The batch architecture in this article uses multi-node computing or PaaS services, which provide high availability.
- Azure database services support zone redundancy, and you can design them to fail over to a secondary node if there's an outage or during a maintenance window.

### Scalability

- The following Azure services in this architecture have autoscaling capabilities:

    - Azure Databricks
    - AKS
    - Spring Apps
    - Batch
    - Azure Functions
    - Logic Apps

- For more information on autoscaling in Azure, see the [autoscaling guide](../../best-practices/auto-scaling.md).

### Security

- This reference architecture uses ExpressRoute for a private and efficient connection to Azure from the on-premises environment. However, you can also create a [site to site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal).
- You can authenticate Azure resources by using Azure AD. You can manage permissions with role-based access control (RBAC).
- Database services in Azure support various security options like Data Encryption at Rest.
- For more information on designing secure solutions, see [Azure security documentation](/azure/security).

### Resiliency

- You can use Azure Monitor and Application Insights, in addition to Log Analytics, to monitor the health of an Azure resource. Set alerts to proactively manage your resource health.
- For more information on resiliency in Azure, see [Designing reliable Azure applications](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/app-design).
