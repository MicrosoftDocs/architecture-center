### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the previous diagram:

1. Input comes from remote clients via Azure ExpressRoute or from other Azure users. TCP/IP is the primary way to connect to the system.

   - On-premises users can access web-based applications over Transport Layer Security (TLS) port 443. The presentation layers of the web applications can remain unchanged to minimize user retraining. Or you can update the presentation layers with modern UX frameworks.

   - On-premises administrative access uses Azure Bastion hosts to maximize security by minimizing open ports.

   - Azure users connect to the system via virtual network peering.

1. In Azure, Azure Load Balancer manages access to the application compute clusters. Load Balancer supports scale-out compute resources to handle input. You can use a level-7 application level or level-4 network level load balancer, depending on how the application input reaches the compute cluster entry point.

1. Application compute clusters can run on Azure VMs or run in containers in AKS clusters. Mainframe system emulation for PL/I or COBOL applications typically uses VMs. Applications refactored to Java or .NET use containers. Some mainframe system emulation software also supports deployment in containers. Compute resources use Azure Premium SSD disks or Azure Ultra Disk Storage with accelerated networking and remote direct memory access (RDMA).

1. Application servers in the compute clusters host the applications based on language capability, such as Java classes or COBOL programs. The servers receive application input and share application state and data by using Azure Cache for Redis or RDMA.

1. Data services in the application clusters support multiple connections to persistent data sources. Azure Private Link provides private connectivity from within the virtual network to Azure services. Data sources can include:

   - Platform as a service (PaaS) data services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale.

   - Databases on VMs, such as Oracle or Db2.

   - Big data repositories like [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/databricks) and Azure Data Lake Storage.

   - Streaming data services like Apache Kafka and [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/stream-analytics).

1. Data storage can be either local-redundant or geo-redundant, depending on usage. Data storage can use a combination of:

   - High-performance storage with Ultra Disk Storage or Premium SSD.

   - File storage with Azure NetApp Files or Azure Files.
   
   - Standard storage, including blob, archive, and backup options.

1. Azure PaaS data services provide scalable and highly available data storage that you can share among compute cluster resources. This storage can also be geo-redundant.

   - Azure Blob Storage is a common landing zone for external data sources.

   - Azure Data Factory supports data ingestion and synchronization of multiple Azure and external data sources.

1. Azure Site Recovery provides disaster recovery (DR) for VM and container cluster components.

1. Services like [Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id), [Azure Networking](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/category/networking), Stream Analytics, Azure Databricks, and [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi/) can easily integrate with the modernized system.

## Scenario details

Refactoring workloads to Azure can transform mainframe applications that run on Windows Server or Linux. You can run these applications more cost effectively by using cloud-based Azure infrastructure as a service and PaaS.

The general refactoring approach for mainframe applications drives infrastructure transformation and shifts systems from legacy proprietary technologies to standardized, benchmarked, open solutions. This transformation supports agile DevOps principles, which are the foundation of today's high-productivity, open-systems standards. Refactoring replaces isolated legacy infrastructures, processes, and applications with a unified environment that enhances business and IT alignment.

This general refactoring approach can use AKS or Azure VMs. The choice depends on the portability of existing applications and your preference. Refactoring can accelerate the move to Azure by automatically converting code to Java or .NET and converting pre-relational databases to relational databases.

Refactoring supports various methods for moving client workloads to Azure. One method is to convert and migrate the entire mainframe system to Azure in a single, comprehensive process. This approach eliminates the need for interim mainframe maintenance and facility support costs. However, this method carries some risk because all application conversion, data migration, and testing processes must align to ensure a smooth transition from the mainframe to Azure.

Another method is to migrate applications from the mainframe to Azure gradually, with the aim to transition over time. This approach provides cost savings for each application. It also provides an opportunity to learn from each conversion to inform and improve subsequent migrations. This method provides a more manageable and less intensive alternative to migrating everything at once by modernizing each application according to its own schedule.

### Potential use cases

Refactoring on Azure can help organizations to:

- Modernize infrastructure and avoid the high costs, limitations, and rigidity of mainframes.
- Migrate mainframe workloads to the cloud while avoiding the complexities of a complete redevelopment.
- Migrate business-critical applications while maintaining continuity with other on-premises applications.
- Benefit from horizontal and vertical scalability on Azure.
- Gain DR capabilities.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Reliability

Reliability helps ensure that your application can meet the commitments that you make to your customers. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist).

In this architecture, [Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) mirrors the Azure VMs to a secondary Azure region for quick failover and DR if the primary Azure datacenter fails.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Security](/azure/well-architected/security/checklist).

- This solution uses an Azure network security group (NSG) to manage traffic between Azure resources. For more information, see [NSGs](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

- Private Link provides private, direct connections isolated to the Azure networking backbone between the Azure VMs and Azure services.

- Azure Bastion maximizes administrative access security by minimizing open ports. Azure Bastion provides highly secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to virtual network VMs from the Azure portal over TLS.

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

- Azure avoids unnecessary costs by identifying the correct number of resource types, analyzing spending over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending. Azure provides cost optimization by running on VMs. You can turn off the VMs when they're not in use and script a schedule for known usage patterns. For more information, see [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and [Recommendations for optimizing component costs](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/optimize-component-costs).

- The VMs in this architecture use either Premium SSD disks or Ultra Disk Storage. For more information, see [Managed disks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks).

- SQL Database optimizes costs by using serverless compute and Hyperscale storage resources that automatically scale. For more information, see [SQL Database pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-sql-database/single).

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs for your implementation of this solution.

### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Operational Excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist).

Refactoring supports faster cloud adoption and promotes the adoption of both DevOps and Agile working principles. You have full flexibility in development and production deployment options.

### Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Performance Efficiency](/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/checklist).

The [load balancers](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) integrate performance efficiency into this solution. If one presentation or transaction server fails, the other servers behind the load balancers handle the workloads.
