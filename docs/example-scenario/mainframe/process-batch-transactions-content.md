The architecture uses AKS to implement compute clusters of the applications that process high-volume batches of transactions. The applications receive the transactions in messages from Service Bus topics or queues. The topics and queues can be at Azure datacenters in different geographic regions, and multiple AKS clusters can read input from them.

> [!Note]
> This architecture suits a type of batch transaction processing that, on IBM mainframes, is often implemented by using the IBM MQ family of message-oriented middleware.

### Workflow

The numbered circles in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps in the following list.

1. The architecture uses Service Bus topics and queues to organize the batch processing input and to pass it downstream for processing.
1. Azure Load Balancer, a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer, distributes incoming traffic among healthy instances of services defined in a load-balanced set. Load balancing and management of connections optimize processing.
1. The AKS cluster worker nodes listen to Service Bus queue endpoints for input.
1. The Java nodes use Java Message Service to connect to Service Bus, and Java interfaces like Java Database Connectivity to connect to other data sources. They use other Java APIs as needed.
1. The recoverable transactions run along with the business code for each batch step.
1. The batch infrastructure uses Azure accelerated networking for speed.
1. Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Stream Analytics provide working storage if needed.
1. The permanent data layer uses Azure Data Factory for data integration and Azure SQL Managed Instance, business critical performance tier, for high availability. The permanent storage is loosely coupled for easy switching to other database technologies, and for optimization of storage organization (using shards or partitions, for example).
1. The data solutions (transitional and permanent) use the Azure Storage geo-redundant storage (GRS) option to protect against catastrophic failures.

## Scenario details

On Azure, you can implement batch transaction processing—such as posting payments to accounts—by using an architecture based on Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Service Bus. This type of architecture provides the transaction processing speed, scaling, and reliability required for high-volume batch processing.

Typically, a message remains queued until its transaction completes, allowing for recovery if there's a failure. Also, you can replicate topics and queues to other regions, to share workloads and to continue processing even if a region fails.

### Potential use cases

The solution is ideal for the finance, education, and science industries. This architecture is for high-volume processing of batches of transactions, especially independent transactions that can be processed in parallel. It's therefore a likely candidate for use in migrating mainframe batch processing. Possible applications are:

- Processing of financial transactions, such as payroll, orders, and payments.
- Processing of experimental data gathered by scientific instruments.
- Other mainframe batch processing.

- For SSD managed disk pricing, see [Managed Disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/) pricing.
- For [Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/), you pay for each protected instance.
- These services are free with your Azure subscription, but you pay for usage and traffic:
  - [Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/load-balancer/).
  - Your activity run volume determines the cost of [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-factory/).
  - For [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network), IP addresses carry a nominal charge.
