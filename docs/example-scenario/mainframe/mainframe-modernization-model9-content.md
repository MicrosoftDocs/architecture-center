### Architecture Workflow

The architecture of BMC AMI Cloud integration with Azure encompasses several components, each playing a pivotal role in the data migration and transformation process. Understanding these components is essential for effective implementation and optimization.

1.	**BMC AMI Cloud Agent:** This is a z/OS started task that sends encrypted and compressed mainframe data to Azure Blob Storage over TCP/IP. It ensures secure and efficient data transfer without the need for intermediate storage, thus reducing latency and potential points of failure.
2.	**BMC AMI Cloud Management Server:** This server manages policies, activities, and storage, ensuring seamless data management. It is a Docker-based web application that facilitates the administration of multiple agents and policies from a centralized interface.
3.	**BMC AMI Cloud Analytics:** This component transforms mainframe data stored in Azure Blob Storage into formats suitable for AI, business intelligence, and machine learning applications. It supports conversion to CSV, JSON, or direct integration with Azure Databases, enabling a wide range of analytical and operational use cases.


### Components

Each component of the BMC AMI Cloud Data is designed to optimize various aspects of the data migration and management process:

- **BMC AMI Cloud Agent:** A Java-based application that runs as a started task on one or more z/OS logical partitions (LPARs). It reads and writes data directly to and from Azure Blob Storage over TCP/IP. The BMC AMI Cloud Agent utilizes the zIIP engines, which dramatically reduces general CPU consumption, thereby optimizing mainframe performance and cost.

- **BMC AMI Cloud Management Server:** A web application running in a Docker container that manages the web UI and communication with z/OS agents. It provides a way to define policies for data protection, migration, and archival, ensuring that data management aligns with organizational requirements and compliance standards.

- **Lifecycle management engine:** A Java-based application that runs on-premises on a z/OS LPAR. It deletes expired data from both object storage and z/OS, automating data lifecycle management and ensuring that storage resources are used efficiently.

- **Data management command-line interface (CLI):** This command-line interface runs on z/OS LPARs and allows users to perform backup, restore, archive, recall, and delete actions to and from Azure Blob Storage. The CLI provides flexibility and control over data management tasks, enabling integration with existing workflows and scripts.

- **BMC AMI Cloud Analytics:** A Docker-based application that transforms BMC AMI Cloud-managed objects into open formats that can be processed by AI, business intelligence, and machine learning applications. This capability allows organizations to unlock the value of their mainframe data by making it accessible to modern analytical tools.

### Networking and identity

Ensuring secure and reliable connectivity between on-premises mainframe systems and Azure cloud services is crucial for the success of any modernization effort:

- [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute) provides a private, reliable connection to Azure services, offering superior performance and security compared to public internet connections. It is ideal for organizations with stringent data sovereignty and compliance requirements.

- [Azure VPN Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/vpn-gateway) sends encrypted traffic between Azure Virtual Network and on-premises locations over the public internet. This solution is suitable for scenarios where a dedicated private connection is not feasible.

- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) synchronizes with on-premises Active Directory for identity and access management. Azure AD supports single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), enhancing security and user experience.

### Storage

- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database): A fully managed, scalable database service with AI-powered features for performance and durability optimization. It supports serverless compute and Hyperscale storage options, automatically scaling resources on demand.

- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/postgresql): A fully managed relational database service that's based on the community edition of the open-source PostgreSQL database engine.
