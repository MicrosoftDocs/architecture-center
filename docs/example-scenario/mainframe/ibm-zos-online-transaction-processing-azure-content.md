### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the preceding diagram:

1. Users connect to the mainframe over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP) by using standard mainframe protocols like TN3270 and HTTPS.

1. The transaction managers interact with the users and invoke the application to satisfy user requests.

1. In the front end of the application layer, users interact with the Customer Information Control System (CICS) or Information Management System (IMS) screens or with webpages.

1. The transaction managers use the business logic written in common business-oriented language (COBOL) or Programming Language One (PL/I) to implement the transactions.

1. Application code uses the storage capabilities of the data layer, such as DB2, IMS DB, or VSAM.

1. In addition to transaction processing, other services provide authentication, security, management, monitoring, and reporting. These services interact with all other services in the system.

The following diagram shows how to migrate this architecture to Azure.
