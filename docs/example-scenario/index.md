# Azure workload examples

Example Workloads show how to solve specific business or technical challenges using Azure. Each scenario is based on a real customer example and provides fast, easy-to-read guidance to accelerate your own implementation.

In each article you'll find an architecture diagram, data flows, and details about the technical components. You will also learn about considerations when running the solution in production, cost factors for the solution, and other options for solving similar problems. Many scenarios provide a way to easily deploy the solution in your own Azure subscription.
