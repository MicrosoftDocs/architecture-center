For the people running a healthcare facility, length of stay (LOS)—the number of days from patient admission to discharge—matters. However, that number can vary across facilities and across disease conditions and specialties, even within the same healthcare system, making it hard to track patient flow and plan accordingly.

This Azure solution helps hospital administrators use the power of machine learning to predict the length of stay for in-hospital admissions, to improve capacity planning and resource utilization. A chief medical information officer might use a predictive model to determine which facilities are overtaxed and which resources to bolster within those facilities. A care line manager might use a model to determine whether there are adequate staff resources to handle the release of a patient.

### Dataflow

The following dataflow corresponds to the above diagram:  

1. **Anonymized health data from electronic health records (EHR) and electronic medical records (EMR)** is extracted using Azure Data Factory with the appropriate runtime (for example: Azure, Self-hosted). In this scenario, we assume anonymized data is accessible for batch extraction using one of the Azure Data Factory connectors, such as ODBC, Oracle, SQL. Other data sources such as FHIR data, may require the inclusion of an intermediary ingestion service like Azure Functions.
   
2. **Azure Data Factory data flows through the Data Factory into Azure Data Lake Storage (gen 2)**. No data is stored in Azure Data Factory during this process, and failures like dropped connections can be handled/retried during this step.  
   
3. **Azure Machine Learning is used to apply machine learning algorithms/pipelines to the data** ingested in step 2. The algorithms can be applied on an event-basis, scheduled, or manually depending on the requirements. Specifically, this includes:   
   
   **3.1 Train** - The ingested data is used to train a machine learning model using a combination of algorithms such as Linear regression and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree. These algorithms are provided via various frameworks (for example, scikit-learn) typically in a pipeline, and may include pre/post-processing pipeline steps. As an example, patient health factors such as admission-type coming from the existing pre-processed (for example, drop null rows) EMR/EHR data could be used to train a regression model like Linear Regression. The model would then be capable of predicting a new patient length of stay.  
     
   **3.2 Validate** - The model performance is compared to existing models/test data, and also against any downstream consumption targets such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  
     
   **3.3 Deploy** - The model is packaged using a container for use in different target environments.  
     
   **3.4 Monitor** - The model predictions are collected and monitored to ensure performance doesn't degrade over time. Alerts can be sent to trigger manual or automated retraining/updates to the model as needed using this monitoring data. Note that additional services like Azure Monitor may be needed, depending on the type of monitoring data extracted.  

4. **Azure Machine Learning output flows to Azure Synapse Analytics**. The model output (predicted patient length of stay) is combined with the existing patient data in a scalable, serving layer like dedicated SQL pool for downstream consumption. Additional analytics such as average length of stay per hospital can be done via Synapse Analytics at this point.  
   
5. **Azure Synapse Analytics provides data to Power BI**. Specifically, Power BI connects to the serving layer in step (4) to extract the data and apply additional semantic modeling needed.  
   
6. **Power BI is used for analysis** by the care line manager and hospital resource coordinator.

## Scenario details

This solution enables a predictive model for LOS for in-hospital admissions. LOS is defined in number of days from the initial admit date to the date that the patient is discharged from any given hospital facility. There can be significant variation of LOS across various facilities, disease conditions, and specialties, even within the same healthcare system. 

Studies such as [Is patient length of stay related to quality of care?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10174462/) have shown that a longer risk-adjusted LOS is correlated with lower received quality of care. Advanced LOS prediction at the time of admission can enhance patient quality of care, by giving providers an expected LOS which they can use as a metric to compare against current patient LOS. This can help to ensure patients with longer than expected LOS receive appropriate attention. LOS prediction also helps with accurate planning for discharges resulting in lowering of various other quality measures such as readmissions.

### Potential use cases

There are two different business users in hospital management who can expect to benefit from more reliable predictions of the length of stay, as well as the patients' families:

- The chief medical information officer (CMIO), who straddles the divide between informatics/technology and healthcare professionals in a healthcare organization. Their duties typically include using analytics to determine if resources are being allocated appropriately in a hospital network. The CMIO needs to be able to determine which facilities are being overtaxed, and specifically what resources at those facilities may need to be bolstered to realign such resources with demand.
- The care line manager, who is directly involved with the care of patients. This role requires monitoring the status of individual patients and ensuring that staff is available to meet the specific care requirements of their patients. The care line manager can make accurate medical decisions and align the right resources well in advance. For example, the ability to predict LOS:
  - as an initial assessment of patients' risk is critical for better [resource planning and allocation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923602000714?via%3Dihub), especially when the resources are limited, as in ICUs.
  - enables care line managers to determine if staff resources will be adequate to handle the release of a patient.
- Predicting the LOS in ICU is also beneficial for patients and their families, as well as insurance companies. An expected date for discharge from the hospital helps patients and their families understand and estimate medical costs. This also gives families an idea about a patient's speed of recovery, and helps them plan for discharge and manage their budgets. 

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

The most expensive component of this solution is the compute and there are several ways to scale the compute cost-effectively with data volume. One example would be to use a Spark service like Azure Synapse Analytics Spark or Azure Databricks for the data engineering work, as opposed to a single node solution. Spark scales horizontally and is more cost-effective compared to large, vertically scaled single node solutions.  

The pricing for all Azure components as configured in this architecture can be found in this [Azure Pricing Calculator saved estimate](https://azure.com/e/c6d436e53c7142c9a5f1622fa13da72e). This estimate is configured to show the estimated upfront and  monthly costs, for a basic implementation that runs 9am-5pm Monday through Friday.

### Operational excellence  

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

A solid Machine Learning operations (MLOps) practice and implementation plays a critical role in the productionalization this type of a solution. For more information, see [Machine learning operations (MLOps)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/machine-learning/mlops/#features).

### Performance efficiency  

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

In this scenario, data pre-processing is performed in Azure Machine Learning. While this design will work for small to medium data volumes, large data volumes or scenarios with near real-time SLAs may struggle from a performance standpoint. One way to address this type of concern is to use a Spark service like Azure Synapse Analytics Spark or Azure Databricks for data engineering or data science workloads. Spark scales horizontally and is distributed by design, allowing it to process large datasets very effectively. 

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This architecture will work with both anonymized and non-anonymized health data. However, for the sake of a secure implementation, we recommend that health data is sourced in anonyized form from EHR and EMR sources.
