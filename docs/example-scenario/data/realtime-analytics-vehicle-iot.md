# Ingestion and processing of real-time automotive IoT data

This example scenario builds a real time data ingestion and processing pipeline to ingest and process messages from IoT devices (in general sensors) into a big data analytic platform in Azure. Vehicle telematics ingestion and processing platforms are the key to create connected car solutions. This specific scenario is motivated by the car telematics ingestion and processing systems. However, the design patterns are relevant for many industries using sensors to manage and monitor complex systems in industries such as smart buildings, communications, manufacturing, retail, and healthcare.

This example demonstrates a real time data ingestion and processing pipeline for messages from IoT devices installed in vehicles. Thousands and millions of messages (or events) are generated by the IoT devices and sensors. By capturing and analyzing these messages, we can decipher valuable insights and take appropriate actions. For example, with cars equipped telematics devices, if we can capture the device (IoT) messages in real time, we would be able to monitor the live location of vehicles, plan optimized routes, provide assistance to drivers, and support telematics-related industries such as auto insurance.

For this example demonstration, imagine a car manufacturing company that wants to create a real time system to ingest and process messages from telematics devices. The company's goals include:

- Ingest and store data in real time from vehicles sensors and devices.
- Analyze the messages to understand vehicle location, and other information emitted through different types of sensors (such as engine-related sensors and environment-related sensors).
- Store the data after analysis for other downstream processing to provide actionable insights (For example, in accident scenarios, insurance agencies may be interested to know what happened during an accident etc.)

## Relevant use cases

Other relevant use cases include:

- Vehicle maintenance reminders and alerting.
- Location-based services for the vehicle passengers (that is, SOS).
- Autonomous (self-driving) vehicles.

## Architecture

In a typical big data processing pipeline implementation, the data flows from left to right. In this real time big data processing pipeline, the data flows through the solution as follows:

1. Events generated from the IoT data sources are sent to the stream ingestion layer through Azure HDInsight Kafka as a stream of messages. HDInsight Kafka stores streams of data in topics for a configurable of time.
2. Kafka consumer, Azure Databricks, picks up the message in real time from the Kafka topic, to process the data based on the business logic and can then send to Serving layer for storage.
3. Downstream storage services, like Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Data warehouse, or Azure SQL DB, will then be a data source for presentation and action layer.
4. Business analysts can use Microsoft Power BI to analyze warehoused data. Other applications can be built upon the serving layer as well. For example, we can expose APIs based on the service layer data for third party uses.

### Components

IoT device-generated events (data or messages) are ingested, processed, and then stored for further analysis, presentation, and action, using the following Azure components:

- [Apache Kafka on HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction) is in the ingestion layer. The data is written into the Kafka topic using a Kafka producer API.
- [Azure Databricks](/services/databricks) is located in the transformation and analytics layer. Databricks notebooks implement a Kafka consumer API to read the data from the Kafka topic.
- [Azure Cosmos DB](/services/cosmos-db), [Azure SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview), and Azure SQL Data Warehouse are in the Serving storage layer, where Azure Databricks can write the data via data connectors.
- [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is) is a distributed system for storing and analyzing large datasets. Its use of massive parallel processing (MPP) makes it suitable for running high-performance analytics.
- [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi) is a suite of business analytics tools to analyze data and share insights. Power BI can query a semantic model stored in Analysis Services, or it can query SQL Data Warehouse directly.
- [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory) authenticates users, when connecting to [Azure Databricks](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/databricks). If we would build a cube in [Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services) based on the model based on Azure SQL Data Warehouse data, we could use AAD to connect to the Analysis Services server through Power BI. Data Factory can also use Azure AD to authenticate to SQL Data Warehouse via a service principal or Managed Service Identity (MSI).
- [Azure App Services](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview), in particular [API App](/services/app-service/api) can be used to expose data to third parties, based on the data stored in the Serving Layer.

## Alternatives

A more generalized big data pipeline could be implemented using other Azure components.

- In the stream ingestion layer, we could use [IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub) or [Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs), instead of [HDInsight Kafka](/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction) to ingest data.
- In the transformation and analytics layer, we could use [HDInsight Storm](/azure/hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-overview), [HDInsight Spark](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview), or [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics).
- [Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services) provides a semantic model for your data. It can also increase system performance when analyzing your data. You can build the model based on Azure DW data.

## Considerations

The technologies in this architecture were chosen based on the scale needed to process events, the SLA of the services, the cost management and ease of management of the components.

- Managed [HDInsight Kafka](/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction) comes with a 99.9% SLA is integrated with Azure Managed Disks
- [Azure Databricks](/azure/azure-databricks/what-is-azure-databricks) is optimized from the ground up for performance and cost-efficiency in the cloud. The Databricks Runtime adds several key capabilities to Apache Spark workloads that can increase performance and reduce costs by as much as 10-100x when running on Azure, including:
- Azure Databricks integrates deeply with Azure databases and stores: [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](/azure/sql-data-warehouse), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db), [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage), and [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs)
  - Autoscaling and autotermination for Spark clusters to automatically minimize costs.
  - Performance optimizations including caching, indexing, and advanced query optimization, which can improve performance by as much as 10-100x over traditional Apache Spark deployments in cloud or on-premises environments.
  - Integration with Azure Active Directory enables you to run complete Azure-based solutions using Azure Databricks.
  - Role-based access in Azure Databricks enables fine-grained user permissions for notebooks, clusters, jobs, and data.
  - Comes with Enterprise-grade SLAs.
- Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database. Azure Cosmos DB was built from the ground up with global distribution and horizontal scale at its core. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. You can elastically scale throughput and storage worldwide, and pay only for the throughput and storage you need.
- The massively parallel processing architecture of SQL Data Warehouse provides scalability and high performance.
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse has guaranteed SLAs and recommended practices for achieving high availability.
- When analysis activity is low, the company can scale Azure SQL Data Warehouse on demand, reducing or even pausing compute to lower costs.
- The Azure SQL Data Warehouse security model provides connection security, authentication, and authorization via Azure AD or SQL Server authentication, and encryption.

## Pricing

Review [Azure Databricks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks), [Azure HDInsight pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight), [pricing sample for a data warehousing scenario](https://azure.com/e/b798fb70c53e4dd19fdeacea4db78276) via the Azure pricing calculator.
