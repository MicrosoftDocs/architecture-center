### Workflow

- This solution is deployed to a single region with storage, GIS desktop, GIS back end, and Azure Virtual Desktop resource groups. Each resource group contains one subnet, and all subnets are in one virtual network. All components are in a single Azure subscription. This architecture is a three-tier deployment.
- The application endpoints are in the on-premises network.
- The Azure Virtual Desktop control plane handles web access, gateway, broker, diagnostics, and extensibility components like REST APIs.
- You manage Microsoft Entra Domain Services and Microsoft Entra ID, Azure subscriptions, virtual networks, [Azure Files or Azure NetApp Files](/azure/virtual-desktop/store-fslogix-profile), and the Azure Virtual Desktop host pools and workspaces.
- GIS analysts, administrators, and editors connect to Azure Virtual Desktop via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session. From there, ArcGIS Pro is accessed and takes advantage of the GPUs for light, medium, and heavy workflows. *Light* refers to a 2D workflow, *medium* refers to a more demanding 2D workflow, and *heavy* refers to a 2D or 3D workflow that requires GPUs. GIS administrators can also use ArcGIS Pro to publish services and administer the enterprise geodatabase. Finally, GIS editors can maintain the vector and raster layers.

  Administrators can also make it possible to publish new versions of ArcGIS Pro by using semantic versioning. For example, as new versions of ArcGIS Pro are available, like ArcGIS Pro 3.0, the new version can be published in the Remote Desktop tool. As a result, users can pick that new version when they're ready to upgrade without having to perform the upgrade themselves. The GPU drivers can be included in the creation of the images that the deployments are based on.

  :::image type="content" source="media/arcgis-rdp.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot that shows ArcGIS and VMs in Remote Desktop.":::

- Web GIS users can also take advantage of this solution by accessing ArcGIS Enterprise administrative interfaces either in the browser in the Azure Virtual Desktop RDP session or via their local browser (if ArcGIS is published as public facing). The Azure application gateway routes the traffic to the correct endpoint for the ArcGIS server roles. As with ArcGIS Pro, the latency between the browsers and the back end are minimized.
- You can deploy the enterprise geodatabase in Azure SQL Managed Instance. ArcGIS Pro users can then create, manage, and edit the geodatabase from an RDP session. During the creation of the Azure Virtual Desktop image, administrators can include the ODBC drivers so users don't have to install them on the Azure Virtual Desktop VMs.
- Azure NetApp Files supports fast access to the ArcGIS Server configuration store and directories. You can use Azure Files and Azure Storage, but Azure NetApp Files costs less for large deployments. Additionally, you can use Azure NetApp Files to store Portal for ArcGIS items and raster images, lidar data, and so on.

### Components

- [Azure NetApp Files](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-netapp-files) is an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file Network-attached storage (NAS) service. In this architecture, it stores ArcGIS Server configuration data, raster images, lidar datasets, and other geospatial files.
- [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) is a collection of tools that provides visibility into the state of your system. In this architecture, Azure Monitor provides visibility into system performance and helps identify and resolve problems that affect your workload's components.
- [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) is a governance tool that enforces rules and standards across Azure resources. In this architecture, it ensures compliance with workload policies, such as resource tagging, location restrictions, and security configurations. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view of the overall state of the environment and the ability to drill down to per-resource, per-policy granularity.
- [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) is an enterprise identity service that provides single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and other identity services to protect against cybersecurity threats. In this architecture, it secures user access to Azure Virtual Desktop and other services.
- [Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) is a directory service that provides traditional domain-based identity services like group policies and Kerberos authentication. It stores directory data and makes that data available to network users and administrators. AD DS stores information about user accounts, like names, passwords, and phone numbers, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access that information. This data store, also known as the *directory*, contains information about Windows Server Active Directory (Windows Server AD) objects. These objects typically include shared resources like servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts. In this architecture, AD DS serves as the centralized identity and access control system. It authenticates users and devices, enforces security policies, and enables secure, single sign-on access to network resources.

  Security is integrated with Windows Server AD through sign-in authentication and controlled access to objects in the directory. With a single network sign-in, administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network, and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network.

- [Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview) is a desktop and application virtualization service that delivers Windows desktops and apps remotely. In this architecture, Azure Virtual Desktop hosts ArcGIS Pro on GPU-enabled VMs so that users can run intensive GIS workflows from anywhere.
- [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-sql-managed-instance/reliability) is a managed SQL Server instance that includes built-in high availability and scalability. In this architecture, SQL Managed Instance stores the enterprise geodatabase, which enables ArcGIS Pro users to manage and edit spatial data in a secure and scalable environment.
- [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-application-gateway) is an application delivery controller-as-a-service offering that provides layer-7 load balancing, security, and web application firewall functionality. In this architecture, it distributes incoming requests to ArcGIS Server roles, which ensures efficient traffic routing and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- [FSLogix](/fslogix/overview-what-is-fslogix) is a profile container solution that improves the user experience in virtual desktop environments. In this architecture, it enables fast logins and persistent user profiles for Azure Virtual Desktop users. It also allows users to roam between remote computing session hosts and optimize file input/output (I/O) between the host or client and the remote profile store.

  For information about FSLogix Profile Container, Azure Files, and Azure NetApp Files best practices, see [FSLogix configuration examples](/fslogix/concepts-configuration-examples).
- [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/virtual-network) is a private cloud-based network that you can use to build your own secure network infrastructure in Azure. It enables secure communication between Azure resources through private IP addresses. In this architecture, Virtual Network connects all components, such as virtual desktops, databases, and storage, within a secure and isolated network.
- [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) is Esri's professional desktop GIS application for spatial analysis, mapping, and data editing. In this architecture, it runs on GPU-enabled Azure Virtual Desktop VMs, which allows users to perform advanced 2D and 3D geospatial tasks and publish services. It runs best on Azure high-performance computing VMs, like the NV-Series. You can scale the use of ArcGIS by using Azure Virtual Desktop.
- [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/what-is-arcgis-enterprise-.htm) is a comprehensive GIS platform for managing and sharing spatial data and services. In this architecture, you can add ArcGIS Enterprise to extend capabilities for hosting maps, apps, and spatial analytics across the organization. It works with ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop (not included here because ArcGIS Pro replaces it).
- [Portal for ArcGIS](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal) is a web-based interface for sharing and managing GIS content within ArcGIS Enterprise. In this architecture, it enables users to create, organize, and share maps, scenes, and apps securely within the organization. Portal for ArcGIS is part of the base deployment.
- [ArcGIS Server](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/get-started/windows/what-is-arcgis-for-server-.htm) is back-end server software that's deployed with ArcGIS Enterprise or in a standalone deployment with ArcGIS Enterprise. In this architecture, it handles requests from users and applications, such as to draw maps, run tools, or query data. Its configuration and data is stored in Azure NetApp Files. It also has a management plane that enables administrators to start, stop, and delete services.
- [ArcGIS Server configuration store](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/10.6/administer/windows/about-the-configuration-store.htm) is a shared file system that stores ArcGIS Server site configuration, including service definitions, logs, and settings. In this architecture, it resides on Azure NetApp Files to ensure high availability and performance for ArcGIS Server operations. It contains system configuration information so that, as ArcGIS Server scales to other machines, it can share that information.
- [Enterprise geodatabase](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/manage-data/windows/enterprise-geodatabases-and-arcgis-enterprise.htm) is a multi-user spatial database that supports versioning, replication, and advanced data models. You can deploy this database in many database management systems. In this architecture, it's hosted in SQL Managed Instance and serves as the authoritative data source for ArcGIS Pro and other GIS tools.

### Alternatives

- You can use [ArcGIS Enterprise Builder](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/arcgis-enterprise-builder.htm) to set up a base ArcGIS Enterprise deployment on a single machine or multiple machines.
- Although Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage are fine for many enterprises, Azure NetApp Files might be better suited for GIS because of large raster image files, Portal for ArcGIS items, shapefiles, lidar datasets, file geodatabases, and other geospatial data types that require fast access.
- You can add other ArcGIS Enterprise server roles, like Raster Analytics Server, GeoAnalytics Server, GeoEvent Server, Knowledge Server, and Mission Server, to this base deployment as needed. You can also use newer technologies, like ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes, as a replacement for or supplement to ArcGIS Enterprise. GPU-based VMs for Drone2Map, CityEngine, and SURE for ArcGIS can also take advantage of these VMs. For more information, see [ArcGIS Enterprise server roles](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/additional-server-deployment.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20base%20ArcGIS%20Enterprise%20deployment%2C%20ArcGIS%20GIS,reference%20your%20own%20data%20sources%2C%20such%20as%20geodatabases.).
- To increase capacity, you can use multiple Azure subscriptions in a hub-and-spoke architecture and connect them via virtual network peering. Also, you can use Azure landing zones to lay down the initial services. For more information, see [What is an Azure landing zone?](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone).

## Scenario details

Esri's technology is a geographic information system (GIS) that contains capabilities for the visualization, analysis, and data management of geospatial data. Esri's core technology is called *the ArcGIS platform*. It includes capabilities for mapping, spatial analysis, 3D GIS, imagery and remote sensing, data collection and management, and field operations. For more information, see the [ArcGIS page](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) on the Esri website.

A desktop app called *ArcGIS Pro* is a key part of the technology. It's a 64-bit professional desktop GIS. GIS analysts can use it to perform spatial analysis and edit spatial data. GIS administrators can use it to create and publish geospatial services.

### Potential use cases

Esri's ArcGIS and virtual desktop solutions are frequently used for:

- Security and regulation applications like utilities (energy), healthcare, and government.
- Elastic workforce needs like remote work, mergers and acquisition, short-term employees, contractors, and partner access.
- Employees like bring your own device (BYOD) users, mobile users, and branch workers.
- Specialized workloads like land management (facilities and real estate), design and engineering, legacy apps, and software testing.

Although GIS has been implemented in Azure for many years, it has typically included only the back-end components. That implementation introduces latency between the client and server components. Organizations have been able to deploy desktop GIS on VMs from Azure Marketplace, but that deployment is for thick clients and isn't very scalable. This architecture addresses both challenges.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Performance Efficiency

Performance Efficiency refers to your workload's ability to scale to meet user demands efficiently. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Performance Efficiency](/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/checklist).

Ideally, the latency between the end user and the RDP session needs to be around 200 ms or less. This latency helps to ensure that, when ArcGIS Pro users interact with maps and perform measurements or edits, the interactive edits and the tooltips appear quickly enough. The [Azure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimator](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/assessment) can provide a quick assessment of connection round-trip time (RTT) from your location, through the Azure Virtual Desktop service, and to each Azure region in which you can deploy virtual machines.

When you use a remote Windows session, your network's available bandwidth greatly affects the quality of your experience. The following table lists the minimum recommended bandwidths for a smooth user experience. These recommendations are based on the guidelines in [Remote Desktop workloads](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/remote-desktop-workloads).

|Workload type  |Recommended bandwidth  |
|---------|---------|
|Light     |1.5 Mbps         |
|Medium     |3 Mbps         |
|Heavy     | 5 Mbps        |
|Power      | 15 Mbps        |

Keep in mind that the stress put on your network depends on both your app workload's output frame rate and your display resolution. If either the frame rate or display resolution increases, the bandwidth requirement also rises. For example, a light workload with a high-resolution display requires more available bandwidth than a light workload with regular or low resolution.

Ideally, all components in the preceding architecture diagram are deployed in a single region to minimize latency between components. However, for large organizations, a multi-region deployment is necessary and supported. Another component to consider is [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor), which routes users to the closest region.

Another significant benefit of this architecture is that the latency between it and Esri's SaaS offerings, like ArcGIS Velocity and ArcGIS Image, is also reduced for ArcGIS Pro users and web browser users. All components of the ArcGIS platform are in the cloud.

#### Scalability

You can scale this architecture in many ways. You can scale the VMs for the back end or the desktops (both CPU and GPUs) in, out, up, or down. You can also deploy Azure Virtual Desktop on individual VMs or multi-session VMs. Azure Virtual Desktop can scale hundreds or thousands of VMs. For more information, see  [Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session remote desktops](/mem/intune/fundamentals/azure-virtual-desktop-multi-session).

#### Testing

You can test your system's latency by using the [Connection Experience Indicator](https://bramwolfs.com/2020/03/11/connection-experience-indicator-for-rds-wvd). You can use [Esri's ArcGIS Pro Performance Assessment Tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/pro-performance-tool-overview.htm) to test the performance. Esri also recommends [tools for testing ArcGIS Enterprise](https://community.esri.com/t5/implementing-arcgis-blog/performance-engineering-load-testing-arcgis/ba-p/1070106#:~:text=Performance%20Engineering%20is%20the%20practice%20of%20proactively%20testing%2C,components%20%28e.g.%20map%20service%20composition%29%20of%20a%20Site.). [Azure Load Testing](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-testing) can also be helpful.

### ArcGIS Pro virtual machine sizing guidelines for Azure Virtual Desktop and Remote Desktop Services

Whether you're running your session host virtual machines on Remote Desktop Services or Azure Virtual Desktop, different types of workloads require different virtual machine configurations. The examples in this article are generic guidelines, and you should only use them for initial performance estimates. For the best possible experience, optimize and scale your deployment depending on your users' needs.

ArcGIS Pro should use Windows 10 and Windows 11 multisession VMs to provide additional flexibility and greater return on investment. It is necessary to allocate the appropriate VM types to give each user enough resources such as GPU, CPU, and RAM. Always consider the number of connections and limit the simultaneous user access to each VM to avoid oversaturation and hindering performance.

### Workloads

Users can run different types of workloads on the session host virtual machines. The following table shows examples of a range of workload types to help you estimate what size your virtual machines need to be. After you set up your virtual machines, continually monitor their actual usage and adjust their size accordingly. If you end up needing a bigger or smaller virtual machine, scale your existing deployment up or down.

The following table describes each ArcGIS workload. *Example users* are the types of users that might find each workload most helpful.

| Workload type | Example user workflows | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | Simple 2-D map display, navigation, and querying. Combining and presenting data prepared by others. | Viewing |
| Medium |2-D and 3-D map display, navigation, querying, and editing. Moderate use of GP tools. Compilation of presentation of data from multiple sources into a simple map layout. | Editing |
| Heavy |2-D and 3-D map display, navigation, querying, and editing. Advanced use of symbology including transparency, and dynamic labeling. Heavy 2-D and 3-D analysis involving visibility, and line of sight. | Visualizing |

Review the [ArcGIS Pro 3.3 system requirements](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm) and [ArcGIS Pro on Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/pro-on-azure-cloud.htm) recommendations to complement your sizing effort.

### Single-session recommendations

*Single-session* scenarios are when there's only one user signed in to a session host virtual machine at any one time. For example, if you use personal host pools in Azure Virtual Desktop, you're using a single-session scenario.

The following table provides examples for single-session ArcGIS Pro scenarios:

| Workload type | Example Azure virtual machine SKU | Activity |
|--|--|--|
| Light | NV4as_v4, NV8as_v4 | Viewing |
| Medium | NV16as_v4, NC4as_T4_v3, NC8as_T4_v3, NV6ads_A10_v5 | Editing |
| Heavy | NC16as_T4_v3, NV12ads_A10_v5, NV18ads_A10_v5 | Visualizing |

### Multi-session recommendations

*Multi-session* scenarios are when there's more than one user signed in to a session host at any one time. For example, when you use pooled host pools in Azure Virtual Desktop with the Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session operating system (OS), that's a multi-session deployment.

The following table provides examples for multi-session ArcGIS Pro scenarios:

| Workload type | Example Azure virtual machine SKU | Maximum users per VM | Activity |
|--|--|--|--|
| Light | NV18ads_A10_v5, NC16as_T4_v3, NV32as_v4 | 6 | Viewing |
| Medium | NV18ads_A10_v5, NC16as_T4_v3, NV32as_v4 | 4 | Editing |
| Heavy | NV18ads_A10_v5, NC16as_T4_v3, NV32as_v4 | 3 | Visualizing |
