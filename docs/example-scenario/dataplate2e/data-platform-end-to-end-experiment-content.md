## Analytics use cases

The analytics use cases covered by the architecture are illustrated by the different data sources on the left-hand side of the diagram. Data flows through the solution from the bottom up as follows:

### Azure data services, cloud native HTAP with Cosmos DB and Dataverse

#### Process

1. [Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link) and [Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/export-to-data-lake) enable you to run near real-time analytics over operational and business application data, by using the analytics engines that are available from your Azure Synapse workspace: [SQL Serverless](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/on-demand-workspace-overview) and [Spark Pools](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-overview).

1. When using Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB, use either a [SQL Serverless query](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/query-cosmos-db-analytical-store?tabs=openrowset-key) or a [Spark Pool notebook](/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/how-to-query-analytical-store-spark). You can access the [Cosmos DB analytical store](/azure/cosmos-db/analytical-store-introduction) and then combine datasets from your near real-time operational data with data from your data lake or from your data warehouse.

1. When using Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse, use either a [SQL Serverless query](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-serverless) or a [Spark Pool notebook](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-spark). You can access the selected Dataverse tables and then combine datasets from your near real-time business applications data with data from your data lake or from your data warehouse.

#### Store

1. The resulting datasets from your [SQL Serverless queries](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/create-external-table-as-select) can be persisted in your data lake.  If you are using [Spark notebooks](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/synapse-spark-sql-pool-import-export), the resulting datasets can be persisted either in your data lake or data warehouse (SQL pool).

#### Serve

1. Load relevant data from the Azure Synapse SQL pool or data lake into [Power BI datasets](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics/integrate-power-bi-with-azure-synapse-analytics/ba-p/2003057) for data visualization and exploration. [Power BI models](/learn/modules/design-model-power-bi) implement a semantic model to simplify the analysis of business data and relationships. Business analysts use [Power BI](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-what-is) reports and dashboards to analyze data and derive business insights.

1. Data can also be securely shared to other business units or external trusted partners using [Azure Data Share](/azure/data-share/share-your-data). Data consumers have the freedom to choose what data format they want to use and also what compute engine is best to process the shared datasets.

1. Structured and unstructured data stored in your Synapse workspace can also be used to build [knowledge mining solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/knowledge-mining) and use AI to uncover valuable business insights across different document types and formats including from Office documents, PDFs, images, audio, forms, and web pages.

### Relational databases

#### Ingest

1. Use [Azure Synapse pipelines](/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) to pull data from a wide variety of databases, both on-premises and in the cloud. Pipelines can be triggered based on a pre-defined schedule, in response to an event, or can be explicitly called via REST APIs.

#### Store

1. [Organize your data lake](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/data-management/best-practices/data-lake-services) following the best practices around which zones to create, what folder structures to use in each zone and what files format to use for each analytics scenario.

1. From the Azure Synapse pipeline, use a [Copy data activity](/azure/data-factory/copy-activity-overview) to stage the data copied from the relational databases into the [raw zone](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/data-architecture-blog/how-to-organize-your-data-lake/ba-p/1182562) of your [Azure Data Lake Store Gen 2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) data lake. You can save the data in delimited text format or compressed as Parquet files.

#### Process and enrich

1. Use either [data flows](/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-overview), [SQL serverless queries](/learn/modules/use-azure-synapse-serverless-sql-pools-for-transforming-data-lake), or [Spark notebooks](/learn/modules/transform-data-with-dataframes-apache-spark-pools-azure-synapse-analytics) to validate, transform, and move the datasets into your Curated zone in your data lake.

    1. As part of your data transformations, you can invoke machine-learning models from your [SQL pools using standard T-SQL](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-predict) or Spark notebooks. These ML models can be used to enrich your datasets and generate further business insights. These machine-learning models can be consumed from [Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-cognitive-services-sentiment) or [custom ML models from Azure ML](/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-sql-pool-model-scoring-wizard).

1. You can serve your final dataset directly from the data lake Curated zone or you can use Copy Data activity to ingest the final dataset into your SQL pool tables using the [COPY command](/sql/t-sql/statements/copy-into-transact-sql) for fast ingestion.

#### Serve

1. Load relevant data from the Azure Synapse SQL pool or data lake into [Power BI datasets](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics/integrate-power-bi-with-azure-synapse-analytics/ba-p/2003057) for data visualization. [Power BI models](/learn/modules/design-model-power-bi) implement a semantic model to simplify the analysis of business data and relationships. Business analysts use [Power BI](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-what-is) reports and dashboards to analyze data and derive business insights.

1. Data can also be securely shared to other business units or external trusted partners using [Azure Data Share](/azure/data-share/share-your-data). Data consumers have the freedom to choose what data format they want to use and also what compute engine is best to process the shared datasets.

1. Structured and unstructured data stored in your Synapse workspace can also be used to build [knowledge mining solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/knowledge-mining) and use AI to uncover valuable business insights across different document types and formats including from Office documents, PDFs, images, audio, forms, and web pages.

### Semi-structured data sources

#### Ingest

1. Use [Azure Synapse pipelines](/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) to pull data from a wide variety of semi-structured data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud. For example:

    - Ingest data from file-based sources containing CSV or JSON files.

For batch/micro-batch pipelines, use either [data flows](/azure/data-factory/concepts-data-flow-overview), [SQL serverless queries](/learn/modules/use-azure-synapse-serverless-sql-pools-for-transforming-data-lake) or [Spark notebooks](/learn/modules/transform-data-with-dataframes-apache-spark-pools-azure-synapse-analytics) to validate, transform, and move your datasets into your Curated zone in your data lake. SQL Serverless queries expose underlying [CSV](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/query-single-csv-file), [Parquet](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/query-parquet-files), or [JSON](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/query-json-files) files as external tables, so that they can be queried using T-SQL.

    1. As part of your data transformations, you can invoke machine-learning models from your [SQL pools using standard T-SQL](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-predict) or Spark notebooks. These ML models can be used to enrich your datasets and generate further business insights. These machine-learning models can be consumed from [Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-cognitive-services-sentiment) or [custom ML models from Azure ML](/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/tutorial-sql-pool-model-scoring-wizard).

1. You can serve your final dataset directly from the data lake Curated zone or you can use Copy Data activity to ingest the final dataset into your SQL pool tables using the [COPY command](/sql/t-sql/statements/copy-into-transact-sql) for fast ingestion.

Configure [Event Hubs Capture](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-capture-overview) or [IoT Hub Storage Endpoints](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c#azure-blob-storage) to save a copy of the events into the [Raw zone](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/data-architecture-blog/how-to-organize-your-data-lake/ba-p/1182562) of your [Azure Data Lake Store Gen 2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) data lake. This feature implements the "Cold Path" of the [Lambda architecture pattern](/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/#lambda-architecture) and allows you to perform historical and trend analysis on the stream data saved in your data lake using [SQL Serverless queries](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/on-demand-workspace-overview) or [Spark notebooks](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-development-using-notebooks?tabs=classical) following the pattern for semi-structured data sources described above.

#### Process and enrich

1. For real-time insights, use a [Stream Analytics job](/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction) to implement the "Hot Path" of the [Lambda architecture pattern](/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/#lambda-architecture) and derive insights from the stream data in transit. Define at least one input for the data stream coming from your [Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/process-data-azure-stream-analytics) or [IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-power-bi), one query to process the input data stream and one Power BI output to where the query results will be sent to.

    1. As part of your data processing with Stream Analytics, you can invoke machine-learning models to enrich your stream datasets and drive business decisions based on the predictions generated. These machine-learning models can be consumed from Azure Cognitive Services or from [custom ML models in Azure Machine learning](/azure/stream-analytics/machine-learning-udf).

#### Serve

1. Business analysts then use [Power BI real-time datasets and dashboard](/power-bi/connect-data/service-real-time-streaming) capabilities to visualize the fast changing insights generated by your Stream Analytics query.

1. Data can also be securely shared to other business units or external trusted partners using [Azure Data Share](/azure/data-share/share-your-data). Data consumers have the freedom to choose what data format they want to use and also what compute engine is best to process the shared datasets.

1. Structured and unstructured data stored in your Synapse workspace can also be used to build [knowledge mining solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/knowledge-mining) and use AI to uncover valuable business insights across different document types and formats including from Office documents, PDFs, images, audio, forms and web pages.

## Discover and govern

Data governance is a common challenge in large enterprise environments. On one hand, business analysts need to be able to discover and understand data assets that can help them solve business problems. On the other hand, Chief Data Officers want insights on privacy and security of business data.

### Microsoft Purview

1. Use [Microsoft Purview](/azure/purview/overview) for [data discovery](/azure/purview/how-to-browse-catalog) and insights on your [data assets](/azure/purview/asset-insights), [data classification](/azure/purview/classification-insights), and [sensitivity](/azure/purview/sensitivity-insights), which covers the entire organizational data landscape.

1. Microsoft Purview can help you maintain a [business glossary](/azure/purview/concept-business-glossary) with the specific business terminology required for users to understand the semantics of what datasets mean and how they are meant to be used across the organization.

1. You can [register all your data sources](/azure/purview/manage-data-sources) and organize them into [Collections](/azure/purview/concept-best-practices-collections), which also serves as a security boundary for your metadata.

1. Setup [regular scans](/azure/purview/create-a-scan-rule-set) to automatically catalog and update relevant metadata about data assets in the organization. Microsoft Purview can also automatically add [data lineage](/azure/purview/catalog-lineage-user-guide) information based on information from Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse pipelines.

1. [Data classification](/azure/purview/apply-classifications) and [data sensitivity](/azure/purview/create-sensitivity-label) labels can be added automatically to your data assets based on pre-configured or customs rules applied during the regular scans.

1. Data governance professionals can use the reports and [insights](/azure/purview/concept-insights) generated by Microsoft Purview to keep control over the entire data landscape and protect the organization against any security and privacy issues.

## Scenario details

This example scenario demonstrates how to use Azure Synapse Analytics with the extensive family of Azure Data Services to build a modern data platform that's capable of handling the most common data challenges in an organization.

## Potential use cases

This approach can also be used to:

- Establish a [data product](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/data-management/architectures/data-landing-zone-data-products) architecture, which consists of a data warehouse for structured data and a data lake for semi-structured and unstructured data. You can choose to deploy a single data product for centralized environments or multiple data products for distributed environments such as Data Mesh. See more information about [Data Management and Data Landing Zones](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/data-management/enterprise-scale-landing-zone).
- Integrate relational data sources with other unstructured datasets, with the use of big data processing technologies.
- Use semantic modeling and powerful visualization tools for simpler data analysis.
- Share datasets within the organization or with trusted external partners.
- Implement knowledge mining solutions to extract valuable business information hidden in images, PDFs, documents, and so on. This scenario applies to most industries, but it's ideal for the media, entertainment, finance, and healthcare industries.

## Considerations

The technologies in this architecture were chosen because each of them provides the necessary functionality to handle the most common data challenges in an organization. These services meet the requirements for scalability and availability, while helping them control costs. The services covered by this architecture are only a subset of a much larger family of Azure services. Similar outcomes can be achieved by using other services or features not covered by this design.

Specific business requirements for your analytics use cases may also ask for the use of different services or features not considered in this design.

Similar architecture can also be implemented for pre-production environments where you can develop and test your workloads. Consider the specific requirements for your workloads and the capabilities of each service for a cost-effective pre-production environment.

### Cost optimization

In general, use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs. The ideal individual pricing tier and the total overall cost of each service included in the architecture is dependent on the amount of data to be processed and stored and the acceptable performance level expected. Use the guide below to learn more about how each service is priced:

- [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/synapse-analytics) serverless architecture allows you to scale your compute and storage levels independently. Compute resources are charged based on usage, and you can scale or pause these resources on demand. Storage resources are billed per terabyte, so your costs will increase as you ingest more data.

- [Azure Data Lake Gen 2](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/data-lake) is charged based on the amount of data stored and based on the number of transactions to read and write data.

- [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/event-hubs) and [Azure IoT Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub) are charged based on the amount of compute resources required to process your message streams.

- [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning) charges come from the amount of compute resources used to train and deploy your machine-learning models.

- [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services) is charged based on the number of call you make to the service APIs.

- [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-purview) is priced based on the number of data assets in the catalog and the amount of compute power required to scan them.

- [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/stream-analytics) is charged based on the amount of compute power required to process your stream queries.

- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) has different product options for different requirements. [Power BI Embedded](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/power-bi-embedded) provides an Azure-based option for embedding Power BI functionality inside your applications. A Power BI Embedded instance is included in the pricing sample above.

- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db) is priced based on the amount of storage and compute resources required by your databases.
