### Dataflow

1. Orchestrators like Azure Logic Apps, Azure Data Factory, or Azure Functions ingest messages and attachments from email servers, and files from FTP servers or web applications.

   - Azure Functions and Logic Apps enable serverless workloads. The service you choose depends on your preference for service capabilities like development, connectors, management, and execution context. For more information, see [Compare Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps](/azure/azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs#compare-azure-functions-and-azure-logic-apps).

   - Consider using Azure Data Factory for bulk data movement.

1. The orchestrators send ingested data to Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake Storage, organizing the data across data stores based on characteristics like file extensions or customers.

1. Form Recognizer Studio, Language Studio, or Azure Machine Learning studio label and tag textual data and build the custom models. You can use these three services independently or in various combinations to address different use cases.

   - If the document requires extracting key-value pairs or creating a custom table from an image format or PDF, use Form Recognizer Studio to tag the data and train the custom model.

   - For document classification based on content, or for domain-specific entity extraction, you can train a custom text classification or Named Entity Recognition (NER) model in Language Studio.

   - Azure Machine Learning studio can also do labeling for text classification or entity extraction with open-source frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

1. To deploy the custom models and use them for inference:

   - Form Recognizer has built-in model deployment. [Use Form Recognizer SDKs or the REST API](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/how-to-guides/use-sdk-rest-api) to apply custom models for inferencing. Include the [model ID](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-1/operations/AnalyzeWithCustomForm) or [custom model name](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v3-0-preview-2/operations/AnalyzeDocument) in the Form Recognizer request URL, depending on the API version. Form Recognizer doesn't require any further deployment steps.

   - Language Studio provides an option to deploy custom language models. Get the REST endpoint [prediction URL](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/custom-named-entity-recognition/how-to/call-api?tabs=language-studio#send-an-entity-recognition-request-to-your-model) by selecting the model to deploy. You can do model inferencing by using either the REST endpoint or the [Azure SDK client libraries](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/custom-named-entity-recognition/how-to/call-api?tabs=client#send-an-entity-recognition-request-to-your-model).

   - Azure Machine Learning can deploy custom models to online or batch [Azure Machine Learning managed endpoints](/azure/machine-learning/concept-endpoints). You can also [deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-azure-kubernetes-service?tabs=python#deploy-to-aks) as a web service by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK.

### Components

- [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps) is part of [Azure Integration Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/integration). Logic Apps creates automated workflows that integrate apps, data, services, and systems. With [managed connectors](/azure/connectors/managed) for services like Azure Storage and Office 365, you can trigger workflows when a file lands in the storage account or email is received.

- [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory) is a managed cloud extract, transform, load (ETL) service for data integration and transformation. Data Factory can add [transformation activities](/azure/data-factory/transform-data) to a pipeline that include invoking a REST endpoint or running a notebook on the ingested data.

- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions) is a serverless compute service that can host event-driven workloads with short-lived processes.

- [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs) is the object storage solution for raw files in this scenario. Blob Storage supports libraries for multiple languages, such as .NET, Node.js, and Python. Applications can access files on Blob Storage via HTTP/HTTPS. Blob Storage has [hot, cool, and archive access tiers](/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview) to support cost optimization for storing large amounts of data.

- [Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage) is a set of capabilities built on Azure Blob Storage for big data analytics. Data Lake Storage retains the cost effectiveness of Blob Storage, and provides features like file-level security and file system semantics with hierarchical namespace.

- [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/form-recognizer), part of [Azure Applied AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/ai/applied-ai-services), has in-built document analysis capabilities to extract printed and handwritten text, tables, and key-value pairs. Form Recognizer has prebuilt models for extracting data from invoices, documents, receipts, ID cards, and business cards. Form Recognizer can also train and deploy custom models by using either a [custom template](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/concept-custom-template) form model or a [custom neural](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/concept-custom-neural) document model.

  [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com) provides a UI for exploring Form Recognizer features and models, and for building, tagging, training, and deploying custom models.

- [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/language-service) consolidates the Azure natural language processing services. The suite offers prebuilt and customizable options. For more information, see the Cognitive Service for Language [available features](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/overview#available-features).

  [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio) provides a UI for exploring and analyzing Azure Cognitive Service for Language features. Language Studio also provides options for building, tagging, training, and deploying custom models.

- [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) is an open platform for managing machine learning model development and deployment at scale.

  - Azure Machine Learning studio provides data labeling options for [images](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects#image-labeling-capabilities) and [text](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-text-labeling-projects).
  - [Export labeled data](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-labeled-dataset#export-data-labels) as [COCO](https://cocodataset.org) or Azure Machine Learning datasets. You can use the datasets for training and deploying models in Azure Machine Learning notebooks. 
  - [Deploy models to AKS](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-azure-kubernetes-service?tabs=python#deploy-to-aks) as a web service for real-time inferencing at scale, or as managed endpoints for both real-time and batch inferencing.

### Alternatives

You can add more workflows to this scenario based on specific use cases.

- If the document is in image or PDF format, you can extract the data by using Azure [Computer Vision](/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr), [Form Recognizer Read API](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/how-to-guides/use-prebuilt-read?pivots=programming-language-python), or open-source libraries.

- You can do [document and conversation summarization](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/text-summarization/overview) by using the prebuilt model in Azure Cognitive Service for Language.

- Use pre-processing code to do text processing steps like cleaning, stop words removal, lemmatization, stemming, and text summarization on extracted data, per document processing requirements. You can expose the code as REST APIs for automation. Do these steps manually or automate them by integrating with the [Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-custom-api-host-deploy-call) or [Azure Functions](/samples/azure-samples/flask-app-on-azure-functions/azure-functions-python-create-flask-app) ingestion process.

## Scenario details

Document processing is a broad area. It can be difficult to meet all your document processing needs with the prebuilt models available in Azure Form Recognizer and Azure Cognitive Service for Language. You might need to build custom models to automate document processing for different applications and domains.

Major challenges in model customization include:

- Labeling or tagging text data with relevant key-value pair entities to classify text for extraction.
- Deploying models securely at scale for easy integration with consuming applications.

### Potential use cases

The following use cases can take advantage of custom models for document processing:

- Build custom NER and text classification models based on open-source frameworks.
- Extract custom key-values from documents for various industry verticals like insurance and healthcare.
- Tag and extract specific domain-dependent entities beyond the [prebuilt NER models](/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-prebuilt-model), for domains like security or finance.
- Create custom tables from documents.
- Extract signatures.
- Label and classify emails or other documents based on content.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

For this example workload, implementing each pillar depends on optimally configuring and using each component Azure service.

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

The total cost of implementing this solution depends on the pricing of the services you choose.

The major costs for this solution are:

- The compute cost involved in Azure Machine Learning training. Choose the right node type, cluster size, and number of nodes to help optimize costs. Azure Machine Learning provides options to set the minimum nodes to zero and to set the idle time before the scale down. For more information, see [Manage and optimize Azure Machine Learning costs](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-optimize-cost).

- Data orchestration duration and activities. For Azure Data Factory, the charges for copy activities on the Azure integration runtime are based on the number of Data Integration Units (DIUs) used and the execution duration. Added orchestration activity runs are also charged, based on their number.
