> This article provides an overview with reference architecture for deploying SWIFT's Alliance Connect Virtual solution on Azure. Please note that the new Alliance Connect Virtual solution is not yet available for SWIFT production traffic. The solution is currently being tested with SWIFT customers and will become generally available throughout 2022 as part of a phased launch. For more information about the general availability of the product, refer to [SWIFT.com](https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/alliance-connect-virtual).

This series of articles provides guidance on using SWIFT's components in Azure. This article discusses the basic components that the architecture examples use in this series.

The intended audiences for this article are program managers, architects, and engineers who are implementing SWIFT's components in Azure. The article is organized into the following structure:

* A high-level overview of the Azure architecture to deploy SWIFT's components (this article).
* A detailed reference architecture for each of the components (links below).

## Architecture

The following diagram is a high-level Azure reference architecture of connectivity to the SWIFT network.
For more information on the SWIFT's components, see [SWIFT Glossary](https://developer.swift.com/glossary).

A SWIFT deployment in Azure contains various components, and the key ones are explained in the next section.

### Customer data center or CoLo

This solution area represents the on-premises site from where business users will interact with SWIFT's components securely. Any other business processing applications that are running on-premises can also connect with SWIFT's components. There must be network connectivity between this site and Azure, where SWIFT's components are deployed.

#### SWIFT's Hardware Security Module (HSM)

In accordance with SWIFT's Customer Security Program (CSP) Control Framework (CSCF), the SWIFT Hardware Security Module (HSM) has to be physically hosted. It can either be on-premises or in a colocation data center. A network connectivity, between a site running HSMs and Azure, is needed for SWIFT's component deployment.

#### Alliance Connect Virtual (vSRX)

SWIFT's Alliance Connect Virtual is the connectivity component that's required to connect to SWIFT, over the SWIFT MVSIPN (Multi-Vendor Secure IP Network). According to SWIFT's Customer Security Programme (CSP) Control Framework (CSCF), the Alliance Connect Virtual is a cloud deployable connectivity solution, which can be virtually hosted in Azure.

### SWIFT messaging and connectivity components

SWIFT offers various connectivity components for secure financial message transfers. Customers can consult SWIFT guidelines to choose a specific connectivity module. Functional requirements, the volume of transactions, and security requirements can influence that choice. The next section describes the key components that are available to banks that process payment message transfers.

#### Alliance Access

Customers with a configuration that's based on Alliance Access need the following components:

* Alliance Access, Web Platform, SAG (SWIFT Alliance Gateway)/SNL (SWIFTNet Link), and an Alliance Connect Virtual network connectivity solution.
* On-premises HSM appliance to secure the messages sent via SWIFTNet.

#### Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH)

Customers with a configuration that's based on Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH) need the following components:

* Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH), Workbench, SAG (SWIFT Alliance Gateway)/SNL (SWIFTNet Link) and Alliance Connect Virtual network connectivity solution.
* On-premises HSM appliance to secure the message sent via SWIFTNet.

#### Alliance Lite 2

A configuration that's based on Alliance Lite 2 needs the following components:

* Alliance Lite 2 AutoClient Virtual Machine and an Alliance Connect Virtual network connectivity solution.
* Physical token management from on-premises.

#### Alliance Cloud

A configuration that's based on Alliance Cloud needs the following components:

* SWIFT Integration Layer (SIL) Virtual Machine and an Alliance Connect Virtual network connectivity solution.
* Physical token management from on-premises.

### Customer's shared Azure services (optional)

This solution area includes services that complement all of SWIFT's components. Shared services can include monitoring, security, compliance, and other key management/operational services. Some of the key services are as shown in following diagram:

[![Diagram showing the SWIFT shared services architecture.](./media/amh-on-azure-shared.png#lightbox)](./media/amh-on-azure-shared.png#lightbox)

* [Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-policy) can be used to enforce more security controls and SWIFT CSP requirements.
* [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps) supports native SWIFT messaging and can be used to natively process and transform messaging, by using 400+ connectors.
* [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) can be used to monitor the SWIFT infrastructure that's running in Azure.
* [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) can be used to integrate authentication and access control, for users accessing SWIFT components.
* [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault) can be used to store the keys and certificates securely, to be used for various SWIFT components. Azure Key Vault is a mandatory component for running Alliance Connect Virtual.

While the proposed architecture recommends using native Azure services, customers can instead choose to use their existing Azure or partner services that meet the requirements.

#### Azure policies

In response to the rapidly increasing cyber threat landscape, SWIFT introduced the Customer Security Program (CSP), with a set of mandatory security controls. Microsoft has developed a blueprint for the CSP framework. Azure Blueprint is a free service that simplifies and supports control implementation. It also enables continuous monitoring and audit. By using Azure Blueprint, customers can define a repeatable set of Azure resources and policies that implement and adhere to standards, patterns, and control requirements. Azure Blueprint allows customers to set up governed Azure environments at scale, in order to aid secure and compliant production implementations. Consider using the latest implementation of SWIFT CSP controls in Azure, after consulting the Microsoft team working with you.

#### Logic Apps

Logic Apps is Microsoft Azure's [integration platform as a service](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/integration) (iPaaS). It's a flexible, containerized, and modern cloud-scale workflow engine that you can run anywhere. Logic Apps now provides native understanding of SWIFT messaging, which enables customers to accelerate the modernization of their payments infrastructure by using the cloud. Hybrid VNet-connected integration capabilities are available to on-premises applications. These capabilities include a wide array of Azure services. Logic Apps provides more than 400 [connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) for intelligent automation, integration, data movement, and more. The SWIFT connectors transform SWIFT flat file messages into XML and vice versa, and they validate based on the document schemas.

Customers can use a Logic Apps service to process payment transactions quickly, which can reduce the implementation time. For example, customers can integrate their backend SAP systems via Logic Apps to SWIFT, to process payment transactions and business acknowledgments. As part of this processing, Logic Apps validates the transactions and checks for duplicates and anomalies.
