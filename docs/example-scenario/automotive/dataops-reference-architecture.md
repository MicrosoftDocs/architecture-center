This article outlines the different Azure building blocks that can help with data operations in the development of Automated Driving.  Data Operations (DataOps) reference architecture provides recommendations as a quick starter for anyone wanting to develop data operation solutions on Azure for Automated Driving (AD).

## Architecture

![DataOps Reference architecture.](.\images\solution-kit.png)

DataOps reference architecture is built upon the framework outlined in the [AVOps reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com).  DataOps is a set of practices, processes, and tools aimed at improving the quality, speed, and reliability of data operations.  The goal of the DataOps flow for automated driving is to ensure that the data used to control the vehicle is of high quality, accurate, and reliable. By following a consistent DataOps flow, organizations improves the speed and accuracy of their data operations and make better decisions to control their autonomous vehicles.  

Data operations in the context of automated driving refers to the processes and techniques used to collect, clean, store, manipulate, and analyze vast amounts of data generated by various sensors and systems in an automated vehicle. The goal of these operations is to extract useful information that can inform decision-making, enabling the vehicle to safely navigate its environment and interact with other road users.

Data operations in automated driving involve:

1. Data Ingestion: Collecting data from various sources such as cameras, lidar, radar, GPS, and other sensors.
1. Data Cleaning: Removing noise, correcting errors, and handling missing data to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.
1. Data Storage: Storing the vast amounts of data generated by an autonomous vehicle in an efficient and scalable manner, such as using cloud-based storage solutions or in-vehicle data storage systems.
1. Data Manipulation: Transforming the data into a format that can be analyzed and used for decision-making. This includes techniques such as data compression, filtering, and feature extraction.
1. Data Analysis: Analyzing the data to extract useful information, such as identifying obstacles, recognizing traffic signs, and making predictions about future road conditions.

The reference architecture contains guidance about these logical building blocks and processes for DataOps, technology recommendations, partner, or open-source solutions for specific areas like simulation and data models.

Here's the high-level process flow of data through the reference architecture:
1. Measurement data include different data streams for different sensors such as camera, radar, ultrasound, lidar and vehicle telemetry.  Data loggers in the vehicle, stores the measurement data on the logger storage device.   The logger storage data is then uploaded to the landing data lake. Ingestion to Azure could be via [Azure Data Box](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databox/), [Azure Stack Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/) or through a dedicated connection such as [Azure ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/). ![Data Collection](.\images\data-collection.png)
1. Data then goes through an extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline where Raw and binary data are stored on [Azure Data Lake Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction). Meta-data are stored in [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db) (depending on final scenario extended by [Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/))
1. Data enrichment helps improve the accuracy and reliability of the data by adding additional information, insights and context to the data collected.
1. Extracted measurement data are provided to labeling partners (Human in the Loop) via [Azure Data Share](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-share/)  and / or labeled via Auto Labeling (usually covered by 3rd party partners) which are stored on separate Data Lake account (“Label Lake”)
1. Labeled data sets are provided to further [MLOps](#mlops) processes, mainly to create a perception and sensor fusion model used by autonomous vehicles to detect scenes (like lane change, blocked roads, pedestrian, traffic lights, traffic signs etc.), COCO or OpenLabel are recommended formats for label data exchange
1. Trained models are validated via Open Loop and Closed Loop testing
1. Visualization of ingested and processed Rosbag file can be served by tools such as [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) running on [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) or [Azure Container Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/)

The image below shows an example scenario of an offline/online collection of vehicle data to a data lake.

## Scenario details

How do we operate a backend to enable Autonomous Vehicles at scale? 
Autonomous Vehicles operations (AVOps) usually require a huge amount of storage and compute to
- Capture and process data and scenes from test vehicles (as learning material for perception model required by vehicles to drive autonomously) 
- Train perception model to recognize the environment as base functionality to drive autonomously 
- Perform safety validation based on open and closed loop simulations

AVOps allows organizations to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud-based infrastructure, while also speeding up the time-to-market for Automated Vehicles.


Challenges

- Data collection: collecting and analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and improve the vehicle's performance over time.  Majority of costs for vehicle development is due to data management and testing.
- Data management: handling the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle's sensors and systems while determining what data is useful.
- Scenario coverage: ensuring the vehicle has been tested in a wide range of scenarios, including different weather conditions, lighting, and road conditions.
- Complexity: managing the large and diverse set of algorithms and systems required for autonomous operation.
- Verification and validation: thoroughly testing the software to ensure it behaves as expected in a wide range of scenarios and environments.
- Data availability:  globally dispersed teams and 3rd parties make sharing of data a challenge.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

* Auto scale and reserved instances
* Geo redundancy

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

It's important to understand the division of responsibility between the automotive OEM and Microsoft. In the vehicle, the OEM owns the whole stack, but as the data moves to the cloud, some responsibilities transfer to Microsoft. Azure platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides built-in security on the physical stack, including the operating system. You can apply the following capabilities on top of the infrastructure security components.

* Private endpoints for network security. For more information, see [Private endpoints for Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/security-network-private-endpoint) and [Allow access to Azure Event Hubs namespaces via private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/private-link-service).
* Encryption at rest and in transit.
* Identity and access management that uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identities and [Azure AD Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access) policies.
* [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access) for Azure Data Explorer.
* Infrastructure governance that uses [Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-policy).
* Data governance that uses [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview).
* Securing the connection of the vehicles - certificate management
* Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
* Use least privilege access: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection
* Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection and improve defenses
* Secure development lifecycle will be used
* These points will drive a Zero Trust Strategy
* It should be clarified if security relevant events must be stored in a central security log analytics workspace
* It should be clarified if “bring your own key” (BYOK) is required. Some customers in automotive sectors are using BYOK


### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

Challenges:

There are several strategies that organizations can use to reduce costs associated with autonomous driving development:

1. Optimize cloud infrastructure: Careful planning and management of cloud infrastructure can help reduce costs, such as choosing cost-effective instance types and scaling infrastructure to meet changing workloads. Utilizing the guidance from the [Azure Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) is recommended.
1. Use spot instances: Spot instances allow organizations to bid on spare capacity, which can result in significant cost savings compared to on-demand instances.
1. Leverage auto-scaling: Auto-scaling enables organizations to automatically adjust their cloud infrastructure based on demand, reducing the need for manual intervention and helping to keep costs in check.
1. Utilize cost-effective storage: Consider how long the data should be stored hot/cold/cold.  Storage can be a significant cost for autonomous driving development, so it's important to choose cost-effective storage options, such as cold storage or infrequent access storage.
1. Utilize cost management and optimization tools: [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management/#overview) provides  cost management and optimization tools that can help organizations identify and address areas where costs can be reduced, such as identifying unused or underutilized resources.
1. Consider Azure Services: Organizations can use Azure services, such as [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning) to build and train autonomous driving models, which can be more cost-effective than building and maintaining in-house infrastructure.
1. Use shared resources: When possible, organizations can use shared resources, such as shared databases or shared compute resources, to reduce costs associated with autonomous driving development.  [Platform Layer](#avops-platform-layer) aims to solve this challenge by implementing a central bus, event hub and a Meta-Data Catalog.  In addition, services such as [Azure Data Share](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-share/) help organizations achieve this goal.

By following these strategies, organizations can reduce the costs associated with autonomous driving development in the cloud, freeing up resources that can be used to further enhance the development process.
### Operational excellence

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

### Performance efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).
