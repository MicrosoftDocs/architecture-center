To secure Azure application workloads, you use protective measures like authentication and encryption in the applications themselves. You can also add security layers to the virtual machine (VM) networks that host the applications, both to protect inbound flows from users, as well as outbound flows to the Internet that your application might require. This article describes [Azure Virtual Network][azure-virtual-network] security services like Azure Firewall and Azure Application Gateway, when to use each service, and network design options that combine both.

- [Azure Firewall][azfw-overview] is a managed next-generation firewall that offers [network address translation (NAT)][nat]. Azure Firewall bases packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports, or on application-based HTTP(S) or SQL attributes. Azure Firewall also leverages Microsoft threat intelligence to identify malicious IP addresses. For more information, see the [Azure Firewall documentation][azfw-docs].
- [Azure Firewall Premium][azfw-premium-features]: is a new offering that includes all functionality of Azure Firewall Standard plus additional features such as TLS-inspection and IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Protection System)
- [Azure Application Gateway][appgw-overview] is a managed web traffic load balancer and HTTP(S) full reverse proxy that can do Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption and decryption. Application Gateway also uses Web Application Firewall to inspect web traffic and detect attacks at the HTTP layer. For more information, see the [Application Gateway documentation][appgw-docs].
- [Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)][web-application-firewall] is an optional addition to Azure Application Gateway to provide inspection of HTTP request and prevent malicious attacks at the web layer such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting. For more information, see the [Web Application Firewall documentation][waf-docs].

These Azure services are complementary. One or the other may be best for your workloads, or you can use them together for optimal protection at both the network and application layers. Use the following decision tree and the examples in this article to determine the best security option for your application's virtual network.

Azure Firewall and Azure Application Gateway leverage different technologies, and support securitization of different flows:

|Application Flow| Can be filtered by Azure Firewall | Can be filtered by WAF on Application Gateway |
| --- | :---: |:---: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from on-premises/Internet to Azure (inbound) | Yes | Yes |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to on-premises/Internet (outbound) | Yes | No |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic, inbound/outbound | Yes | No |

As a consequence, depending on the network flows that an application requires, the design can be different on a per-application basis. The following diagram offers a simplified decision tree that helps choosing the recommended approach for an application, depending on whether it is published via HTTP(S) or some other protocol:

![Virtual network security decision tree](./images/decision-tree-simple.png)

This article will cover the widely recommended designs from the flow chart, as well as others that are applicable in less common scenarios:

- [Azure Firewall alone](#azure-firewall-only) when there are no web applications in the virtual network, it will control both inbound traffic to the applications as well as outbound traffic.
- [Application Gateway alone](#application-gateway-only) when there are only web applications in the virtual network, and [network security groups (NSGs)][nsgs] provide sufficient output filtering. This scenario is typically not recommended because of the rich functionality of Azure Firewall over NSGs, that can prevent many attack scenarios such as data exfiltration. This is why this scenario is not documented in the flow chart above.
- [Azure Firewall and Application Gateway in parallel](#firewall-and-application-gateway-in-parallel), one of the most common designs, when you want Azure Application Gateway to protect HTTP(S) applications from web attacks, and Azure Firewall to protect all other workloads and filter outbound traffic.
- [Application Gateway in front of Azure Firewall](#application-gateway-before-firewall) when you want Azure Firewall to inspect all traffic and WAF to protect web traffic, and the application needs to know the client's source IP address. With Azure Firewall Premium and TLS inspection, this design supports as well end-to-end SSL scenario.
- [Azure Firewall in front of Application Gateway](#application-gateway-after-firewall) when you want Azure Firewall to inspect and filter traffic before it reaches the Application Gateway. Since the Azure Firewall is not going to decrypt HTTPS traffic, the functionality it is adding to the Application Gateway is very limited, hence why this scenario is not documented in the flow chart above.

Variations of the previous fundamental designs are described in the last section of this document, and include [on-premises application clients](#on-premises-clients), [hub and spoke networks](#hub-and-spoke-topology), and [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][aks-overview] implementations. You can add additional reverse proxy services like an [API Management][apim-overview] gateway or [Azure Front Door][frontdoor], or you can replace the Azure resources with third-party [network virtual appliances](#other-network-virtual-appliances).

## Azure Firewall only

If there are no web-based workloads in the virtual network that can benefit from WAF, you can use Azure Firewall only. The design in this case is simple, but reviewing the packet flow will help understand more complex designs.

The following table summarizes the traffic flows for this scenario:

| Flow | Goes through Application Gateway / WAF | Goes through Azure Firewall |
| ---- | :--: | :--: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure     | N/A | Yes (see below) |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem     | N/A | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure | N/A | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem | N/A | Yes |

Azure Firewall will not inspect inbound HTTP(S) traffic, but will be able to apply L3/L4 rules as well as FQDN-based application rules. Azure Firewall will inspect outbound HTTP(S) traffic depending on the Azure Firewall tier and whether you configure TLS inspection or not:

- Azure Firewall Standard will only inspect Layer 3-4 attributes of the packets in network rules, as well as the Host HTTP header in application rules
- Azure Firewall Premium will add capabilities such as inspecting other HTTP headers (such as the User-Agent for example) as well as enabling TLS inspection for deeper packet analysis. Bear in mind though that the Azure Firewall is not equivalent to a Web Application Firewall, so if you have web workloads in your Virtual Network using a Web Application Firewall is highly recommended.

The following packet walk example shows how a client accesses a VM-hosted application from the public internet. The diagram includes only one VM for simplicity. For higher availability and scalability, you'd have multiple application instances behind a load balancer.

![Firewall only](./images/design1_500.png)

1. The client initiates the connection to the public IP address of the Azure Firewall:
   - Source IP address: ClientPIP
   - Destination IP address: AzFwPIP
2. The Azure Firewall [Destination NAT (DNAT) rule][azfw-dnat] translates the destination IP address to the application IP address inside the virtual network. The Azure Firewall also *Source NATs (SNATs)* the packet if it performs DNAT. For more information, see [Azure Firewall known issues][azfw-issues]. The VM sees the following IP addresses in the incoming packet:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.100.7 
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
3. The VM answers the application request, reversing source and destination IP addresses. The inbound flow doesn't require a *user-defined route (UDR)*, because the source IP is Azure Firewall's IP address. The UDR in the diagram for 0.0.0.0/0 is for outbound connections, to make sure packets to the public internet go through the Azure Firewall.
   - Source IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.100.7
4. Finally, Azure Firewall undoes the SNAT and DNAT operations, and delivers the response to the client:
   - Source IP address: AzFwPIP
   - Destination IP address: ClientPIP

In this design, Azure Firewall inspects both incoming connections from the public internet, and outbound connections from the application subnet VM by using the UDR.

- The IP address `192.168.100.7` is one of the instances the Azure Firewall service deploys under the covers, here with the front-end IP address `192.168.100.4`. These individual instances are normally invisible to the Azure administrator, but noticing the difference is useful in some cases, such as when troubleshooting network issues.

- If traffic comes from an on-premises virtual private network (VPN) or [Azure ExpressRoute][expressroute] gateway instead of the internet, the client initiates the connection to the VM's IP address, not to the firewall's IP address, and the firewall will do no Source NAT per default.

## Application Gateway only

This design covers the use case when only web applications exist in the virtual network, and inspecting outbound traffic with Network Security Groups (NSGs) is considered as enough protection for outbound flows to the Internet.

 >[!NOTE]
 > This is not a recommended design since using Azure Firewall to control outbound flows (instead of only NSGs) will prevent certain attack scenarios such as data exfiltration, where you make sure that your workloads are only sending data to an approved list of URLs.
 

The main difference from the previous design with only the Azure Firewall is that the Application Gateway doesn't act as a routing device with NAT, but behaves as a full reverse application proxy. That is, Application Gateway terminates the web session from the client, and establishes a separate session with one of its backend servers.

The following table summarizes traffic flows:

| Flow | Goes through Application Gateway / WAF | Goes through Azure Firewall |
| ---- | :--: | :--: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure     | Yes | N/A |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem     | No  | N/A |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure | No  | N/A |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem | No  | N/A |

The following packet walk example shows how a client accesses the VM-hosted application from the public internet.

![Application Gateway only](./images/design2_500.png)

1. The client initiates the connection to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway:
   - Source IP address: ClientPIP
   - Destination IP address: AppGwPIP
2. The Application Gateway instance that receives the request terminates the connection from the client, and establishes a new connection with one of the back ends. The back end sees the Application Gateway instance as the source IP address. The Application Gateway inserts an *X-Forwarded-For* HTTP header with the original client IP address.
   - Source IP address: 192.168.200.7 (the private IP address of the Application Gateway instance)
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - X-Forwarded-For header: ClientPIP
3. The VM answers the application request, reversing source and destination IP addresses. The VM already knows how to reach the Application Gateway, so doesn't need a UDR.
   - Source IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.200.7
4. Finally, the Application Gateway instance answers the client:
   - Source IP address: AppGwPIP
   - Destination IP address: ClientPIP

Azure Application Gateway adds metadata to the packet HTTP headers, such as the *X-Forwarded-For* header containing the original client's IP address. Some application servers need the source client IP address to serve geolocation-specific content, or for logging. For more information, see [How an application gateway works][appgw-networking].

- The IP address `192.168.200.7` is one of the instances the Azure Application Gateway service deploys under the covers, here with the front-end IP address `192.168.200.4`. These individual instances are normally invisible to the Azure administrator, but noticing the difference is useful in some cases, such as when troubleshooting network issues.

- The flow is similar if the client comes from an on-premises network over a VPN or ExpressRoute gateway, except the client accesses the private IP address of the Application Gateway instead of the public address.

## Firewall and Application Gateway in parallel

Due to its simplicity and flexibility, running Application Gateway and Azure Firewall in parallel is often the best scenario.

Implement this design if there's a mix of web and non-web workloads in the virtual network. Azure WAF protects inbound traffic to the web workloads, and the Azure Firewall inspects inbound traffic for the other applications. The Azure Firewall will cover outbound flows from both workload types.

The following table summarizes the traffic flows for this scenario:

| Flow | Goes through Application Gateway / WAF | Goes through Azure Firewall |
| ---- | :--: | :--: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure     | Yes | No |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem     | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem | No  | Yes |

This design gives much more granular egress filtering than NSGs. For example, if applications need connectivity to a specific Azure Storage Account, you can use *fully qualified domain name (FQDN)*-based filters to make sure that applications are not sending data to rogue storage accounts, which could not be prevented just by using NSGs. Hence this design is often used where outbound traffic requires FQDN-based filtering, for example when [limiting egress traffic from an Azure Kubernetes Services cluster][aks-egress].

The following diagram illustrates the traffic flow for inbound connections from an outside client:

![Application Gateway and Azure Firewall in parallel, ingress flow](./images/design3_ingress_500.png)

The following diagram illustrates the traffic flow for outbound connections from the network VMs to the internet, for example to connect to backend systems or get operating system updates:

![Application Gateway and Azure Firewall in parallel, egress flow](./images/design3_egress_500.png)

The packet flow steps for each service are the same as in the previous standalone design options.

## Application Gateway before Firewall

In this option, inbound web traffic goes through both Azure Firewall and WAF. The WAF provides protection at the web application layer, and Azure Firewall acts as a central logging and control point and inspects traffic between the Application Gateway and the backend servers. The Application Gateway and Azure Firewall aren't sitting in parallel, but one after the other.

With [Azure Firewall Premium][azfw-premium-features] this design can support end-to-end scenarios, where the Azure Firewall leverages TLS inspection to perform Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPS) on the encrypted traffic between the Application Gateway and the web backend.

This design is appropriate for applications that need to know incoming client source IP addresses, for example to serve geolocation-specific content or for logging. Azure Firewall SNATs the incoming traffic, changing the original source IP address. Application Gateway in front of Azure Firewall captures the incoming packet's source IP address in the *X-forwarded-for* header, so the web server can see the original IP address in this header. For more information, see [How an application gateway works][appgw-networking].

The following table summarizes the traffic flows for this scenario:

| Flow | Goes through Application Gateway / WAF | Goes through Azure Firewall |
| ---- | :--: | :--: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure     | Yes | Yes |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem     | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem | No  | Yes |

For web traffic from on-premises or Internet to Azure, the Azure Firewall will inspect flows that have already been allowed by the Web Application Firewall. Depending on whether the Application Gateway encrypts backend traffic (traffic from the Application Gateway to the application servers) or not, you will have two different potential scenarios:

1. The Application Gateway encrypts traffic following zero-trust principles ([End-to-End TLS encryption](/azure/application-gateway/ssl-overview#end-to-end-tls-encryption)), the Azure Firewall will receive encrypted traffic. Still, Azure Firewall Standard will be able to apply inspection rules such as L3/L4 filtering in network rules or FQDN (Fully-Qualified Domain Name) filtering in application rules  using the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) header, and [Azure Firewall Premium][azfw-premium-features] will provide deeper visibility with IDPS (Intrusion Detection Protection System), such as URL-based filtering for example.
1. If the Application Gateway is sending unencrypted traffic to the application servers, the Azure Firewall will see inbound traffic in clear text, and TLS inspection is not needed in the Azure Firewall.
1. If IDPS is enabled in the Azure Firewall, it will verify that the HTTP Host header matches the destination IP. With that purpose, it will need name resolution for the Fully-Qualified Domain Name specified in the Host header. This name resolution can be achieved with Azure DNS Private Zones and the default Azure Firewall DNS settings using Azure DNS, or with custom DNS servers that need to be configured in the Azure Firewall settings (see [Azure Firewall DNS Settings][azfw-dns] for more information). This latter method is the only possibility if there is not administrative access to the Virtual Network where the Azure Firewall is deployed, as with Azure Firewalls deployed in Virtual WAN Secured Hubs. 

For the rest of the flows (inbound non-HTTP(S) traffic and any outbound traffic) the Azure Firewall will provide IDPS inspection as well as TLS inspection where appropriate, as well as [FQDN-based filtering in network rules][azfw-dns] based on DNS.

![Application Gateway before Azure Firewall](./images/design4_500.png)

Network traffic from the public internet follows this flow:

1. The client initiates the connection to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway:
   - Source IP address: ClientPIP
   - Destination IP address: AppGwPIP
2. The Application Gateway instance terminates the connection from the client, and establishes a new connection with one of the back ends. The UDR to `192.168.1.0/24` in the Application Gateway subnet forwards the packet to the Azure Firewall, while preserving the destination IP to the web application:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.200.7 (private IP address of the Application Gateway instance)
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - X-Forwarded-For header: ClientPIP
3. Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT the traffic, since it's going to a private IP address, and forwards the traffic to the application VM if rules allow it. For more information, see [Azure Firewall SNAT][azfw-snat].
   - Source IP address: 192.168.200.7 (the private IP address of the Application Gateway instance)
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - X-Forwarded-For header: ClientPIP
4. The VM answers the request, reversing source and destination IP addresses. The UDR to `192.168.200.0/24` captures the packet sent back to the Application Gateway and redirects it to Azure Firewall, while preserving the destination IP toward the Application Gateway.
   - Source IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.200.7
5. Here again the Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT the traffic, since it's going to a private IP address, and forwards the traffic to the Application Gateway.
   - Source IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.200.7
6. Finally, the Application Gateway instance answers the client:
   - Source IP address: AppGwPIP
   - Destination IP address: ClientPIP

Outbound flows from the VMs to the public internet go through Azure Firewall, as defined by the UDR to `0.0.0.0/0`.

## Application Gateway after Firewall

This design lets Azure Firewall filter and discard malicious traffic before it reaches the Application Gateway, for example by leveraging features like threat intelligence-based filtering. Another benefit of this design is that the application gets the same public IP address for both inbound and outbound traffic.

However, there is limited added value in this scenario, since Azure Firewall will only see encrypted traffic going to the Application Gateway. There might be scenarios where this design is preferred though, for example if there is another WAF earlier in the network (for example with [Azure Front Door][afd-overview]), or if multiple public IP addresses are required.

The following table summarizes the traffic flows for this scenario:

| Flow | Goes through Application Gateway / WAF | Goes through Azure Firewall |
| ---- | :--: | :--: |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure     | Yes | Yes (see below) |
| HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem     | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Internet/onprem to Azure | No  | Yes |
| Non-HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to Internet/onprem | No  | Yes |

For inbound HTTP(S) traffic, the Azure Firewall would typically not decrypt traffic, and apply IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) policies that do not require TLS inspection, like IP-based filtering or using HTTP headers.

A significant downside of this design is that the application can't see the original source IP address of the web traffic, because the Azure Firewall SNATs the packets as they come in to the virtual network. A workaround is to use [Azure Front Door][afd-overview] in front of the firewall to inject the client's IP address as HTTP header before it enters the Azure virtual network.

![Application Gateway after Azure Firewall](./images/design5_500.png)

Network traffic from the public internet follows this flow:

1. The client initiates the connection to the public IP address of the Azure Firewall:
   - Source IP address: ClientPIP
   - Destination IP address: AzFWPIP
2. The Azure Firewall DNATs the web port, usually TCP 443, to the private IP address of the Application Gateway instance. Azure Firewall also SNATs when doing DNAT. For more information, see [Azure Firewall known issues][azfw-issues]:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.100.7 (the private IP address of the Azure Firewall instance)
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.200.4
3. The Application Gateway establishes a new session between the instance handling the connection and one of the backend servers. Note that the original IP address of the client isn't in the packet:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.200.7 (the private IP address of the Application Gateway instance)
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - X-Forwarded-For header: 192.168.100.7
4. The VM answers the Application Gateway, reversing source and destination IP addresses:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.1.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.200.7
5. The Application Gateway replies to the SNAT source IP address of the Azure Firewall instance. Even if the connection is coming from a specific Application Gateway instance like `.7`, Azure Firewall sees the internal IP address of the Application Gateway `.4` as the source IP:
   - Source IP address: 192.168.200.4
   - Destination IP address: 192.168.100.7
6. Finally, Azure Firewall undoes SNAT and DNAT and answers the client:
   - Source IP address: AzFwPIP
   - Destination IP address: ClientPIP

Even if the Application Gateway has no listeners configured for applications, it still needs a public IP address so Microsoft can manage it.

> [!NOTE]
> A default route to `0.0.0.0/0` in the Application Gateway subnet pointing to the Azure Firewall is not supported, since it would break the control plane traffic required for the correct operation of the Azure Application Gateway.

## On-premises clients

The preceding designs all show application clients coming from the public internet. On-premises networks also access applications. Most of the preceding information and traffic flows are the same as for internet clients, but there are some notable differences:

- A VPN gateway or ExpressRoute gateway sits in front of Azure Firewall and/or Application Gateway.
- WAF uses the private IP address of the Application Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't support DNAT for private IP addresses. Therefore, you must use UDRs to send inbound traffic to Azure Firewall from the VPN or ExpressRoute gateways.
- Make sure to verify caveats around *forced tunneling* for the [Azure Application Gateway][appgw-defaultroute] and for the [Azure Firewall][azfw-defaultroute]. Even if your workload doesn't need outbound connectivity to the public internet, you can't inject a default route like `0.0.0.0/0` for the Application Gateway that points to the on-premises network, or you'll break control traffic. For Azure Application Gateway, the default route needs to point to the public internet.

The following diagram shows the Azure Application Gateway and Azure Firewall parallel design, with application clients coming from an on-premises network connected to Azure over VPN or ExpressRoute:

![Hybrid design with VPN or ExpressRoute gateway](./images/hybrid_500.png)

Even if all clients are located on-premises or in Azure, both the Azure Application Gateway and the Azure Firewall need to have public IP addresses, so that Microsoft can manage the services.

## Hub and spoke topology

The designs in this article still apply in a *hub and spoke* topology, where shared resources in a central hub virtual network connect to applications in separate spoke virtual networks via virtual network peerings.

![Hybrid design with VPN/ER Gateway and hub and spoke](./images/hubnspoke_500.png)

Some considerations for this topology include:

- The Azure Firewall is usually deployed in the central hub virtual network, but components such as Azure Application Gateways or Azure API Management gateways are often managed by application teams, and hence they are deployed in the spoke virtual networks.
- Pay special attention to UDRs in the spoke networks: When an application server in a spoke receives traffic from a specific Azure Firewall instance, like the `192.168.100.7` address in the previous examples, it should send return traffic back to the same instance. If a UDR in the spoke sets the next hop of traffic addressed to the hub to the Azure Firewall IP address (`192.168.100.4` in the diagrams above), return packets might end up on a different Azure Firewall instance, causing asymmetric routing. Make sure that if you have UDRs in the spoke VNets to send traffic to shared services in the hub through the Azure Firewall, these UDRs do not include the prefix of the Azure Firewall subnet.
- The previous recommendation applies equally to the Application Gateway subnet and any other Network Virtual Appliances or reverse proxies that might be deployed in the hub VNet.
- Note that you cannot set the next hop for the Application Gateway or Azure Firewall subnets by means of static routes with a next hop type of `Virtual Network`, since this next hop type is only valid in the local VNet, and not across VNet peerings. See more information about User Defined Routes and next hop types in [Virtual network traffic routing][udr].

The diagram below shows the situation where a spoke sends back SNATted traffic back to the ALB of an Azure Firewall, hence causing asymmetric routing:

![Asymmetric routing in hub and spoke](./images/asymmetric_routing.png)

The solution for this asymmetric routing problem is defining UDRs in the spoke that do not contain the Azure Firewall subnet, but only the subnets where the shared services are located. In the example of the previous diagram, the correct UDR in the spoke should only contain 192.168.1.0/24, and not the whole 192.168.0.0/16 as marked in red.
   
## Integration with other Azure products

You can integrate Azure Firewall and Azure Application Gateway with other Azure products and services.

### API Management Gateway

Integrate reverse proxy services like [API Management][apim] gateway into the previous designs to provide functionality like API throttling or authentication proxy. Integrating an API Management gateway doesn't greatly alter the designs. The main difference is that instead of the single Application Gateway reverse proxy, there are two reverse proxies chained behind each other.

For more information, see the [Design Guide to integrate API Management and Application Gateway in a virtual network][appgw-apim] and the application pattern [API Gateways for Microservices][app-gws].

### Azure Kubernetes Service

For workloads running on an AKS cluster, you can deploy Azure Application Gateway independently of the cluster, or you can integrate it with the AKS cluster using the [Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller][agic_overview]. The benefit of this integration is that when configuring certain objects at the Kubernetes levels such as services and ingresses, the Application Gateway automatically adapts without needing additional manual steps.

Azure Firewall plays an important role in AKS cluster security, since it offers the required functionality to filter egress traffic from the AKS cluster based on FQDN and not just IP address. For more information, see [Control egress traffic for AKS cluster nodes][aks-egress].

When using Application Gateway and Azure Firewall together to protect an AKS cluster, it's best to use the parallel design option. The Application Gateway with WAF processes inbound connection requests to web applications in the cluster, and Azure Firewall permits only explicitly allowed outbound connections.

### Azure Front Door

[Azure Front Door][frontdoor] functionality partly overlaps with Azure Application Gateway. For example, both services offer web application firewalling, SSL offloading, and URL-based routing. One main difference is that while Azure Application Gateway is inside a virtual network, Azure Front Door is a global, decentralized service.

In some situations, you can simplify virtual network design by replacing Application Gateway with a decentralized Azure Front Door. Most of the designs described in this document are still valid, except for the option of placing Azure Firewall in front of Azure Front Door.

An interesting use case is using Azure Firewall in front of Application Gateway in your virtual network. As described earlier, the `X-Forwarded-For` header injected by the Application Gateway will contain the firewall instance's IP address, not the client's IP address. A workaround is to use Azure Front Door in front of the firewall to inject the client's IP address as a `X-Forwarded-For` header before the traffic enters the virtual network and hits the Azure Firewall.

For more information about the differences between the two services, or when to use each one, see [Frequently Asked Questions for Azure Front Door][afd-vs-appgw].

## Other network virtual appliances

Microsoft products aren't the only choice to implement web application firewall or next-generation firewall functionality in Azure. A wide range of Microsoft partners provide network virtual appliances (NVAs). The concepts and designs are essentially the same as in this article, but there are some important considerations:

- Partner NVAs for next-generation firewalling may offer more control and flexibility for NAT configurations not supported by the Azure Firewall, such as DNAT from on-premises, or DNAT from the internet without SNAT.
- Azure-managed NVAs like Application Gateway and Azure Firewall reduce complexity, compared to NVAs where users need to handle scalability and resiliency across multiple appliances.
- When using NVAs in Azure, use *active-active* and *autoscaling* setups, so these appliances aren't a bottleneck for applications running in the virtual network.
