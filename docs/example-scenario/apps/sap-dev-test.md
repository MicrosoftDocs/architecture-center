# Dev/test environments for SAP workloads on Azure

This example shows how to establish a dev/test environment for SAP NetWeaver in a Windows or Linux environment on Azure. The database used is AnyDB, the SAP term for any supported DBMS (that isn't SAP HANA). Because this architecture is designed for non-production environments, it's deployed with just a single virtual machine (VM) and it's size can be changed to accommodate your organization's needs.

For production use cases review the SAP reference architectures available below:

- [SAP NetWeaver for AnyDB][sap-netweaver]
- [SAP S/4HANA][sap-hana]
- [SAP on Azure large instances][sap-large]

## Relevant use cases

Other relevant use cases include:

- Non-critical SAP non-productive workloads (sandbox, development, test, quality assurance)
- Non-critical SAP business workloads

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram for dev/test environments for SAP workloads](./media/architecture-sap-dev-test.png)

This scenario demonstrates provisioning a single SAP system database and SAP application server on a single virtual machine. The data flows through the scenario as follows:

1. Customers use the SAP user interface or other client tools (Excel, a web browser, or other web application) to access the Azure-based SAP system.
2. Connectivity is provided through the use of an established ExpressRoute. The ExpressRoute connection is terminated in Azure at the ExpressRoute gateway. Network traffic routes through the ExpressRoute gateway to the gateway subnet, and from the gateway subnet to the application-tier spoke subnet (see the [hub-spoke network topology][hub-spoke]) and via a Network Security Gateway to the SAP application virtual machine.
3. The identity management servers provide authentication services.
4. The jump box provides local management capabilities.

### Components

- [Virtual Networks](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) are the basis of network communication within Azure.
- [Virtual Machine](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/overview) Azure Virtual Machines provides on-demand, high-scale, secure, virtualized infrastructure using Windows or Linux Server.
- [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider.
- [Network Security Group](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) lets you limit network traffic to resources in a virtual network. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- [Resource Groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) act as logical containers for Azure resources.

## Considerations

### Availability

Microsoft offers a service level agreement (SLA) for single VM instances. For more information on Microsoft Azure Service Level Agreement for Virtual Machines [SLA For Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines)

### Scalability

For general guidance on designing scalable solutions, see the [scalability checklist][scalability] in the Azure Architecture Center.

### Security

For general guidance on designing secure solutions, see the [Azure Security Documentation][security].

### Resiliency

For general guidance on designing resilient solutions, see [Designing resilient applications for Azure][resiliency].

## Pricing

To help you explore the cost of running this scenario, all of the services are pre-configured in the cost calculator examples below. To see how the pricing would change for your particular use case, change the appropriate variables to match your expected traffic.

We have provided four sample cost profiles based on amount of traffic you expect to receive:
