# Running SAP production workloads using an Oracle Database on Azure

SAP systems are used to run mission-critical business applications. Any outage disrupts key processes and can cause increased expenses or lost revenue. Avoiding these outcomes requires an SAP infrastructure that is highly available and resilient when failures occur.

Building a highly available SAP environment requires eliminating single points of failures in your system architecture and processes. Single points of failure can be caused by site failures, errors in system components, or even human error.

This example scenario demonstrates an SAP deployment on Windows or Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Azure, along with a High Availability (HA) Oracle database. For your SAP deployment, you can use VMs of different sizes based on your requirements.

## Relevant use cases

Other relevant use cases include:

- Mission-critical workloads running on SAP.
- Non-critical SAP workloads.
- Test environments for SAP that simulate a high-availability environment.

## Architecture

![Architecture overview of a production SAP environment in Azure][architecture]

This example includes a high availability configuration for an Oracle database, SAP central services, and multiple SAP application servers running on different virtual machines. The Azure network uses a [hub-and-spoke topology](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) for security purposes. The data flows through the solution as follows:

1. Users access the SAP system via the SAP user interface, a web browser, or other client tools like Microsoft Excel. An ExpressRoute connection provides access from the organization's on-premises network to resources running in Azure.
2. The ExpressRoute terminates in Azure at the ExpressRoute virtual network (VNet) gateway. Network traffic is routed to a gateway subnet through the ExpressRoute gateway created in the hub VNet.
3. The hub VNet is peered to a spoke VNet. The application tier subnet hosts the virtual machines running SAP in an availability set.
4. The identity management servers provide authentication services for the solution.
5. The jump box is used by system administrators to securely manage resources deployed in Azure.

### Components

- [Virtual Networks](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) are used in this scenario to create a virtual hub-and-spoke topology in Azure.

- [Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/overview) provide the compute resources for each tier of the solution. Each cluster of virtual machines is configured as an [availability set](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/regions-and-availability#availability-sets).

- [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) extends your on-premises network into the Microsoft cloud through a private connection established by a connectivity provider.

- [Network Security Groups (NSG)](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) limit network access to the resources in a virtual network. An NSG contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol.

- [Resource Groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) act as logical containers for Azure resources.

### Alternatives

SAP provides flexible options for different combinations of operating system, database management system, and VM types in an Azure environment. For more information, see [SAP note 1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533), "SAP Applications on Azure: Supported Products and Azure VM Types".

## Considerations

- Recommended practices are defined for building highly available SAP environments in Azure. For more information, see [High-availability architecture and scenarios for SAP NetWeaver](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-high-availability-architecture-scenarios). Also see [High availability of SAP applications on Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide).

- Oracle databases also have recommended practices for Azure. For more information, see [Designing and implementing an Oracle database in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-design).

- Oracle Data Guard is used to eliminate single points of failure for mission critical Oracle databases. For more information, see [Implementing Oracle Data Guard on a Linux virtual machine in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/configure-oracle-dataguard).

- Microsoft Azure offers infrastructure services that can be used to deploy SAP products with an Oracle database. For more information, see [Deploying an Oracle DBMS on Azure for an SAP workload](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/dbms_guide_oracle).
