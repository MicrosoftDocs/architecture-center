# Secure Azure Web App Deployments to ILB ASE

This example scenario walks you through application deployment in your intranet environment using Azure App Service Environment service and securely connect to Azure SQL DB over VNet service endpoint. This scenario will also show how you can expose this application to internet in a secure manner using Azure Application Gateway service which includes Web Application Firewall. This will also show one of the best practices to setup continuous integration & continuous deployment to ILB ASE using Azure DevOps to automate build & release of an application.

## Relevant use cases

Consider this scenario for the following use cases:

* Building an Azure Web App where customer has additional security requirements to have additional layer of deployment protection behind 
an Azure VNET
* Customers desire a deployment to a dedicated tier, rather than be in a shared tier App Service Plans

## Architecture

![Sample scenario architecture for Secure ILB ASE Deployment ][architecture]

This scenario covers the data flows through the scenario as follows:

1. TO DO: ADD Flow Here

### Components

* ILB [App Service Environment][intro-to-app-svc-env] The Azure App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale. 
* [Isolated App Service Plan Pricing Tier][isolated-tier-pricing-and-ase-pricing] The Isolated service plan is designed to run mission critical workloads, that are required to run in a virtual network. The Isolated plan allows customers to run their apps in a private, dedicated environment in an Azure datacenter using Dv2-series VMs with faster processors, SSD storage, and double the memory-to-core ratio compared to Standard
* Azure App Services [Web App][docs-webapps] and [API App][docs-apiapps] hosts web applications and RESTful APIs allowing autoscale and high availability without having to manage infrastructure.

* Application Gateway with WAF Enabled
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure Networking
* Azure DevOps
* Build Azure VM

### Alternatives


Other options for the data tier include:

* [Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction): Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database. This service provides a platform to run other data models such as Mongo DB, Cassandra, Graph data, or simple table storage.

## Considerations
The real trick here is generating a certificate that chained up to a trusted root without requiring a Certificate Signing Request generated by the server on which the cert will be eventually placed. In other words, with IIS for example the first step is to generate a CSR from your IIS server and then send it to the SSL certificate issuing authority. 

You cannot issue a CSR from the Internal Load Balancer (ILB) of an ASE. The way to handle this is to use [this procedure][create-wildcard-cert-letsencrypt]

The above allows you to use proof of DNS name ownership instead of a CSR. If you own a DNS namespace, you can put in special DNS TXT record, the above service checks that the record is there, and if found, knows that you own the DNS server because you have the right record.
Based on that, it issues a certificate that is signed up to a trusted root, which you can then upload to your ILB. You donâ€™t need to do anything with the individual certificate stores on the Web Apps because you have a trusted root SSL certificate at the ILB.

Make self-signed or internally issued SSL cert work if we want to make secure calls between services running in ILB ASE
Another [solution to consider][ase-and-internally-issued-cert] on how to make ILB ASE work with internally issued SSL certificate and how to load the internal CA to the trusted root store.

### Availability

* Consider leveraging the [typical design patterns for availability][design-patterns-availability] when building your cloud application.
* Review the availability considerations in the appropriate [App Service web application reference architecture][app-service-reference-architecture]
* For additional considerations concerning availability, see the [availability checklist][availability] in the Azure Architecture Center.

### Scalability

* When building a cloud application be aware of the [typical design patterns for scalability][design-patterns-scalability].
* Review the scalability considerations in the appropriate [App Service web application reference architecture][app-service-reference-architecture]
* For other scalability topics, see the [scalability checklist][scalability] available in the Azure Architecture Center.

### Security

* Consider leveraging the [typical design patterns for security][design-patterns-security] where appropriate.
* Review the security considerations in the appropriate [App Service web application reference architecture][app-service-reference-architecture].
* Consider following a [secure development lifecycle][secure-development] process to help developers build more secure software and address security compliance requirements while reducing development cost.
* Review the blueprint architecture for [Azure PCI DSS compliance][pci-dss-blueprint].

### Resiliency

* Consider leveraging the [circuit breaker pattern][circuit-breaker] to provide graceful error handling should one part of the application not be available.
* Review the [typical design patterns for resiliency][design-patterns-resiliency] and consider implementing these where appropriate.
* You can find a number of [recommended practices for App Service][resiliency-app-service] in the Azure Architecture Center.
* Consider using active [geo-replication][sql-geo-replication] for the data tier and [geo-redundant][storage-geo-redudancy] storage for images and queues.
* For a deeper discussion on [resiliency][resiliency], see the relevant article in the Azure Architecture Center.

## Deploy the scenario

To deploy this scenario, you can follow this [step-by-step tutorial][end-to-end-walkthrough] demonstrating how to manually deploy each component. This tutorial also provides a .NET sample application that runs a simple Contoso Expenses reporting application. 

## Pricing

Explore the cost of running this scenario, all of the services are pre-configured in the cost calculator. To see how the pricing would change for your particular use case change the appropriate variables to match your expected traffic.

We have provided three sample cost profiles based on amount of traffic you expect to get:

* [Small][small-pricing]: This pricing example represents the components necessary to build the out for a minimum production level instance. Here we are assuming a small number of users, numbering only in a few thousand per month. The app is using a single instance of a standard web app that will be enough to enable autoscaling. Each of the other components are scaled to a basic tier that will allow for a minimum amount of cost but still ensure that there is SLA support and enough capacity to handle a production level workload.
* [Medium][medium-pricing]: This pricing example represents the components indicative of a moderate size deployment. Here we estimate approximately 100,000 users using the system over the course of a month. The expected traffic is handled in a single app service instance with a moderate standard tier. Additionally, moderate tiers of cognitive and search services are added to the calculator.
* [Large][large-pricing]: This pricing example represents an application meant for high scale, at the order of millions of users per month moving terabytes of data. At this level of usage high performance, premium tier web apps deployed in multiple regions fronted by traffic manager is required. Data consists of the following: storage, databases, and CDN, are configured for terabytes of data.
