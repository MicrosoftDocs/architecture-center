This example scenario discusses a [highly available][High availability] solution for a web app with private connectivity to a SQL database. A single-region architecture already exists for a web app with private database connectivity. This solution extends that base architecture by making it highly available.

See [Web app private connectivity to Azure SQL Database][Web app private connectivity to Azure SQL database] for information on the base architecture.

To offer high availability, this solution:

- Deploys a secondary instance of the solution in another Azure region.
- [Uses auto-failover groups for geo-replication and high availability of the database][Use auto-failover groups to enable transparent and coordinated failover of multiple databases].

You can achieve high availability with a [complete region failover][Complete region failover]. However, this solution uses a partial region failover. With this approach, only components with issues fail over:

- If the primary database fails over, the web app in the primary region connects to the newly activated secondary database while maintaining private connectivity.
- If the app goes down in the primary region, the instance in the secondary region takes over. That instance connects to the primary database, which is still active.

## Potential use cases

With private connectivity to a SQL database and high availability, this solution has applications in many areas. Examples include the financial, healthcare, and defense industries.

   The diagram contains two vertically aligned boxes, one for a primary region and one for a secondary region. Each box contains a web app icon, a box for a virtual network, and a database icon. Outside the boxes on the left, a cloud represents the internet. Arrows point from that cloud through a Traffic Manager and then into the web app in each box. The arrow leading into the secondary region box is dashed. Inside each box, arrows connect the web app, the virtual network, and the database. More arrows cross from the virtual network in each region into the database in the other region. All arrows that end in the secondary database are dashed. Outside each box on the right, a cloud represents the internet. A red arrow that is marked with a letter x points from each cloud to the database in its region. An arrow with points on both ends that is labeled Database Geo-replication connects the two databases. Icons for private DNS zones are located at the top and the bottom of the diagram.

### General case

In the general case, the traffic flow and basic configuration look like the [single-region version][Web app private connectivity to Azure SQL database].

#### Traffic flow

1. Azure Traffic Manager routes requests from the internet to a web app.
1. By using Azure App Service regional VNet Integration, the web app connects to a delegated subnet named **AppSvcSubnet** in Azure Virtual Network.
1. Azure Private Link sets up a [private endpoint for the Azure SQL Database][How to set up Private Link for Azure SQL Database] in a virtual network subnet named **PrivateLinkSubnet**. The web app connects to this private endpoint.
1. The database firewall only lets in traffic coming from the **PrivateLinkSubnet** private endpoint.
1. The database is inaccessible from the public internet. Only components inside or connected to the virtual network can reach the database.

#### Configuration

For the web app to work with Azure DNS private zones, this architecture uses App Service VNet Integration. When the web app and database run in the same region, the configuration is straightforward. As [Azure DNS private zones][Azure DNS Private Zones] explains, when you set `WEBSITE_VNET_ROUTE_ALL` to `1`, the DNS resolution works correctly within the region.

For cross-region private connectivity, the configuration is challenging. With regional VNet Integration, [you can't reach resources across global peering connections][Regional VNet Integration]. As a result, [global peering][Virtual network peering] between the virtual networks isn't an option. When the primary database fails over to the secondary region, the web app in the primary region can't reach the private endpoint of the secondary database.

To overcome this limitation, this architecture gives each database *two* private endpoints. Instead of one total, each database has one private endpoint *in each region*. This approach is possible because:

- [You can create multiple private endpoints for the same resource][Can I connect my service to multiple Private Endpoints?]. As a result, you can expose two private endpoints for the same database.
- [A private endpoint in one region can connect to an Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resource in another region][Can private endpoint connect to Azure PaaS resources across Azure regions?]. In this case, you create a private endpoint for the primary database in the secondary region and vice versa.
- [You can create multiple private endpoints in the same virtual network][Can I create multiple Private Endpoints in same VNet? Can they connect to different Services?]. The private endpoints for both database instances can exist in the same network and [even in the same subnet][Do I require a dedicated subnet for private endpoints?].

### Specific cases

The following cases result when specific databases and web apps are active.

In all scenarios, the web app connects to the currently active database over a fully private connection without requiring a configuration change. In both regions, the web app uses a connection string that includes a `Server` host name. That host name refers to the DNS name of the SQL failover group. An example is:

`Server=tcp:sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=...`

Since both regions use the same connection string, you don't need to change that string when a database fails over.

#### Primary database is active

Since this architecture uses a SQL failover group, when the primary database is active:

- The DNS name `sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net` resolves to the host name of the currently active database, `sql-primary.database.windows.net`.
- The database has private endpoints turned on, so the DNS name `sql-primary.database.windows.net` resolves to `sql-primary.privatelink.database.windows.net`.

##### Primary web app is active

In this case:
- Internet requests arrive at the primary web app (**1**).
- The web app connects to the primary **AppSvcSubnet** subnet (**2**).
- The web app accesses the database:
  - As configured, the Azure DNS private zone resolves `sql-primary.privatelink.database.windows.net` to `10.1.1.4`.
  - The app connects to the private endpoint of the primary database (**3**).
- The app and database run in the same region (**4**).

Summary of DNS resolution:

`sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net => sql-primary.database.windows.net => sql-primary.privatelink.database.windows.net => 10.1.1.4`

##### Secondary web app is active

The secondary web app is active in either of these cases:

- The primary web app fails over the secondary region.
- Traffic Manager routes traffic to both regions simultaneously in an active-active configuration.

When the secondary web app is active:

- Internet requests arrive at the secondary web app (**1\***).
- The web app connects to the secondary **AppSvcSubnet** subnet (**2\***).
- The web app accesses the database:
  - As configured, the Azure DNS private zone in the secondary region resolves `sql-primary.privatelink.database.windows.net` to `10.2.1.5`.
  - The app connects to the private endpoint of the primary database (**3\***). The virtual network in the secondary region makes that endpoint available. Since that connectivity is local from the web app's point of view, global peering isn't needed.
- The app and database run in different regions (**4\***). The cross-region traffic results in increased latency.

Summary of DNS resolution:

`sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net => sql-primary.database.windows.net => sql-primary.privatelink.database.windows.net => 10.2.1.5`

#### Secondary database is active

When the primary database fails over:

- The SQL failover group's DNS record changes. The DNS name `sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net` resolves to the newly active database in the secondary region, `sql-secondary.database.windows.net.`
- Since the secondary database has private endpoints turned on, the DNS name `sql-secondary.database.windows.net` resolves to `sql-secondary.privatelink.database.windows.net`.

##### Primary web app is active

In this case:

- Internet requests arrive at the primary web app (**1**).
- The web app connects to the primary **AppSvcSubnet** subnet (**2**).
- The web app accesses the database:
  - As configured, the Azure DNS private zone in the primary region resolves `sql-secondary.privatelink.database.windows.net` to `10.1.1.5`.
  - The app connects to the local private endpoint of the secondary database (**3\*\***).
- The app and database run in different regions (**4\*\***). The cross-region traffic results in increased latency.

Summary of DNS resolution:

`sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net => sql-secondary.database.windows.net => sql-secondary.privatelink.database.windows.net => 10.1.1.5`

##### Secondary web app is active

In this case:

- Internet requests arrive at the secondary web app (**1\***).
- The web app connects to the secondary **AppSvcSubnet** subnet (**2\***).
- The web app accesses the database:
  - As configured, the Azure DNS private zone in the secondary region resolves `sql-secondary.privatelink.database.windows.net` to `10.2.1.4`.
  - The app connects to the private endpoint of the secondary database (**3\*\*\***).
- The app and database run in the same region (**4\*\*\***).

Summary of DNS resolution:

`sql-failovergroup.database.windows.net` => `sql-secondary.database.windows.net` => `sql-secondary.privatelink.database.windows.net` => `10.2.1.4`

### Components

- [App Service][Azure App Service] and its [Web Apps][Azure Web Apps] feature provide a framework for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. The App Service platform offers built-in infrastructure maintenance, security patching, and scaling.

- [App Service VNet Integration][Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network] connects apps to Azure resources. If you use Virtual Network to set up a non-internet-routable network, the VNet Integration feature gives apps access to resources in that network. The [regional variation of VNet Integration][Regional VNet Integration] works with virtual networks in the same region as the app.

- An [Azure DNS private zone][What is a private Azure DNS zone] contains records that you can't resolve from the internet. DNS resolution only works from virtual networks that are linked to the private zone.

- [Azure Private Endpoint][What is Azure Private Endpoint?] is a network interface that connects privately and securely to a service that Private Link powers.

- [Private Link][What is Azure Private Link?] provides a private endpoint in a virtual network. You can use the private endpoint to connect to Azure PaaS services like Azure Storage and SQL Database or to customer or partner services.

- [SQL Database][What is Azure SQL Database?] is a general-purpose relational database managed service that supports relational data, spatial data, JSON, and XML.

- [Traffic Manager][What is Traffic Manager?] is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service distributes traffic to public-facing applications across global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness.

- [Virtual Network][What is Azure Virtual Network?] is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs) can securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks through Virtual Network.

### Alternatives

- In general, the [alternatives that are appropriate for the single-region version][Alternatives to the single-region version] also apply to this solution.

- Instead of using a partial region failover, you can use a complete region failover. As [Highly available multi-region web application][Highly available multi-region web application] explains, when a single component fails with this approach, the architecture fails over the entire region. For example, an issue in the primary region web app can trigger a database failover. Traffic Manager or [Azure Front Door][What is Azure Front Door?] then shifts all traffic to the app in the secondary region.

  A complete region failover requires no cross-region connectivity. Instead, you treat your entire solution as an isolated [deployment stamp][Deployment stamps] that moves from one region to another as one unit. But this approach has disadvantages. Triggering a [database failover can cause data loss][Fail over to a geo-replicated secondary database] because of the asynchronous nature of database replication. This loss can occur even when the database has no issues.

- As with the single-region version, this approach isn't limited to SQL Database. You can also use this scenario with [any service that supports a Private Endpoint][Private link resource] for inbound connectivity. Examples include:

  - Azure Storage
  - Azure Cosmos DB
  - Azure Cognitive Search
  - Azure Event Grid
  - Function Apps
  - Other web apps

## Considerations

In general, the [considerations that apply to the single-region version][Considerations that apply to the single-region version] also apply to this solution. Keep the following points in mind, too.

### Availability considerations

- This solution deploys additional private endpoints in the remote regions. As a result, this solution overcomes the [global peering limitation][Global peering limitation] that applies to the single-region version. This approach also achieves a higher availability than a single-region deployment does.

- From the point of view of the web app, you can use this architecture in either an active-passive configuration or an active-active configuration. With an active-active approach, Traffic Manager routes traffic to both regions simultaneously.

### Performance considerations

A partial region failover involves cross-region connectivity, which increases latency. Instead of staying within a single region, app requests to the database cross the Azure network backbone into a remote Azure region.

Some implementations can temporarily tolerate this behavior. After the failed app or database is restored, connectivity returns to normal inside a single region. However, in environments with strict latency requirements, even short-lived cross-region connectivity may pose a problem.

### Security considerations

As with the single-region scenario, the web apps in this solution use fully private connections to securely connect to both backend databases. The public internet can't access either of the database servers. This type of setup eliminates a common attack vector.

## Deploy this scenario

Follow these steps to deploy this scenario:

1. Deploy the two regions separately by following the steps in the [single-region version][Deploy this scenario single-region version]. But note the following points:

   - You need at least two resource groups for this complete scenario for these reasons:

     - The Azure resource that represents a private DNS zone uses the actual DNS zone name, such as `privatelink.database.windows.net`.
     - You can't have different private DNS zones with the same name within a single resource group.
  
     It's best to deploy all resources that you host in the same Azure region into the same resource group.

   - To avoid confusion, choose non-overlapping IP address ranges for the virtual networks in both regions. This approach isn't required but is best if you plan on peering the networks for other reasons later on.

   - Only create the logical SQL Server in the secondary region. Don't create the SQL Database itself. The process of setting up the SQL failover group automatically creates and replicates the secondary database.

1. [Create the SQL failover group][Create the SQL failover group]. This step replicates the database across the two regions. Ensure the application uses the failover group DNS name in its connection string.

1. Deploy and configure the additional cross-regional private endpoints for both databases:

   1. [Create an additional private endpoint for each database][Create a Private Endpoint] but select the subnet in the *other* region's virtual network.
   1. Look up the IP address for the newly created private endpoint in the local virtual network. For example:

      - In the primary region, the address for the secondary database might be `10.1.1.5`.
      - In the secondary region, the address for the primary database might be `10.2.1.5`.

   1. Add that IP address as an A record to the `privatelink.database.windows.net` private DNS zone that's linked to the local virtual network. For example:

      - In the primary region, set `sql-secondary` to `10.1.1.5`.
      - In the secondary region, set `sql-primary` to `10.2.1.5`.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/app-service-private-sql-multi-region-add-record-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to add an A record for the secondary database in the primary region.":::

At this point:

- The apps in both regions should connect to both databases over their private endpoints.
- Both apps should continue to function even if the database fails over to the other region.

## Pricing

- This solution effectively doubles the [cost of the single-region version][Cost of the single-region version]. But certain circumstances can affect this estimate:

  - You use a scaled-down version of the App Service plan in the standby region and scale it up only when it becomes the active region.
  - You have significant cross-region traffic. [Network traffic between Azure regions incurs charges][Bandwidth Pricing Details].

- Make sure that [the primary and secondary databases use the same service tier][Configuring secondary database]. Otherwise, the secondary database may not keep up with replication changes.
