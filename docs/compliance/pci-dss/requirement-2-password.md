# Password requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 2

**Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Malicious individuals (external and internal to an entity) often use vendor default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise systems. These passwords and settings are well known by hacker communities and are easily determined via public information.

## PCI DSS Requirement 2.1
 
**2.1** Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts **before** installing a system on the network.
This applies to ALL default passwords, including but not limited to those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings, etc.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure Active Directory password policy requirements are enforced for the new passwords supplied by customers within the AADUX portal. Customer-initiated self-service password changes require validation of prior password. Administrator reset passwords are required to be changed upon subsequent login. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore requires users to use set strong passwords for all users. No sample or guest accounts are enabled in the demo.<br /><br />Wireless and SNMP are not implemented in the solution.|



### PCI DSS Requirement 2.1.1

**2.1.1** For wireless environments connected to the cardholder data environment or transmitting cardholder data, change ALL wireless vendor defaults at installation, including but not limited to default wireless encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP community strings.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | Wireless and SNMP are not implemented in the solution.|



## PCI DSS Requirement 2.2

**2.2** Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards.
Sources of industry-accepted system hardening standards may include, but are not limited to:
- Center for Internet Security (CIS)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- SysAdmin Audit Network Security (SANS) Institute
- National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST)

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | For Microsoft Azure, the OSSC Technical Security Services team develops security configuration standards for systems in the Microsoft Azure environment that are consistent with industry-accepted hardening standards. These configurations are documented in system baselines and relevant configuration changes are communicated to impacted teams (e.g., IPAK team). Procedures are implemented to monitor for compliance against the security configuration standards. The security configuration standards for systems in the Microsoft Azure environment are consistent with industry-accepted hardening standards and are reviewed at least annually. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore provides hardening of all services in scope for the cardholder data environment (CDE). <br /><br />The Contoso Webstore also deploys the [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), which provides a centralized view of the security state of all your Azure resources. At a glance, you can verify that the appropriate security controls are in place and configured correctly, and you can quickly identify any resources that require attention.<br /><br />The Contoso Webstore utilizes Operations Management Suite to log all system changes. [Operations Management Suite (OMS)](/azure/operations-management-suite/) provides extensive logging of changes. Changes can be reviewed and verified for accuracy. For more specific guidance, see [PCI Guidance - Operations Management Suite](index.md#logging-and-auditing).|



### PCI DSS Requirement 2.2.1

**2.2.1** Implement only one primary function per server to prevent functions that require different security levels from co-existing on the same server. (For example, web servers, database servers, and DNS should be implemented on separate servers.) 

> **Note:** Where virtualization technologies are in use, implement only one primary function per virtual system component.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**
