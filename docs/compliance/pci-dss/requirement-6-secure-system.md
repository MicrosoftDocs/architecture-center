# Secure system requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 6

**Develop and maintain secure systems and applications**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Unscrupulous individuals use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor-provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All systems must have all appropriate software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of cardholder data by malicious individuals and malicious software.
Note: Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict with existing security configurations. For in-house developed applications, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by using standard system development processes and secure coding techniques.

## PCI DSS Requirement 6.1

**6.1** Establish a process to identify security vulnerabilities, using reputable outside sources for security vulnerability information, and assign a risk ranking (for example, as “high,” “medium,” or “low”) to newly discovered security vulnerabilities.

> **Note:** Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score, and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected. 
> 
> Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk-assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a “high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Procedures have been established and implemented to scan for vulnerabilities on hypervisor hosts in the scope boundary. Vulnerability scanning is performed on server operating systems, databases, and network devices with the appropriate vulnerability scanning tools. The vulnerability scans are performed on a quarterly basis at minimum. Microsoft Azure contracts with independent assessors to perform penetration testing of the Microsoft Azure boundary. Red-Team exercises are also routinely performed and results used to make security improvements. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities using an Application Gateway with WAF, and the OWASP ruleset enabled. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Mitigation of the Risk of Security Vulnerabilities](index.md#application-gateway).|



## PCI DSS Requirement 6.2

**6.2** Ensure that all system components and software are protected from known vulnerabilities by installing applicable vendor-supplied security patches. Install critical security patches within one month of release.

> **Note:** Critical security patches should be identified according to the risk ranking process defined in Requirement 6.1.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure is responsible for ensuring all network devices and hypervisor OS software is protected from known vulnerabilities by installing applicable vendor-supplied security patches. Unless a customer requests to not use the service, a patch management process exists to ensure that operating system level vulnerabilities are prevented and remediated in a timely manner. Production servers are scanned to validate patch compliance on a monthly basis. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore is a PaaS service solution. Azure provides maintenance of all service patches.|



## PCI DSS Requirement 6.3

**6.3** Develop internal and external software applications (including web-based administrative access to applications) securely, as follows:
- In accordance with PCI DSS (for example, secure authentication and logging)
- Based on industry standards and/or best practices
- Incorporating information security throughout the software-development life cycle 

> **Note:** This applies to all software developed internally as well as bespoke or custom software developed by a third party.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure applications and endpoints are developed in accordance with the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) methodology which is in line with DSS requirements. |

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | A Final Security Review (FSR) is performed for major releases prior to production deployment by a designated Security Advisor outside of the Azure development team to ensure only applications ready for production are released. As part of this final review it is ensured that all test accounts and test data have been removed. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore provides a staging service that is logged and isolated. Each of the network tiers has a dedicated network security group [NSG]. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Network Security Groups](index.md#network-security-groups).|



### PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.2

**6.3.2** Review custom code prior to release to production or customers in order to identify any potential coding vulnerability (using either manual or automated processes) to include at least the following:
- Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author, and by individuals knowledgeable about code-review techniques and secure coding practices.
- Code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines
- Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release
- Code-review results are reviewed and approved by management prior to release 

> **Note:** This requirement for code reviews applies to all custom code (both internal and public-facing), as part of the system development life cycle. 
>
> Code reviews can be conducted by knowledgeable internal personnel or third parties. Public-facing web applications are also subject to additional controls, to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.6.
