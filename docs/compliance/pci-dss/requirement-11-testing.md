# Testing requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 11

**Regularly test security systems and processes**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Vulnerabilities are being discovered continually by malicious individuals and researchers, and being introduced by new software. System components, processes, and custom software should be tested frequently to ensure security controls continue to reflect a changing environment.

## PCI DSS Requirement 11.1

**11.1** Implement processes to test for the presence of wireless access points (802.11), and detect and identify all authorized and unauthorized wireless access points on a quarterly basis.
> **Note:** Methods that may be used in the process include but are not limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical inspections of system components and infrastructure, network access control (NAC), or wireless IDS/IPS.
Whichever methods are used, they must be sufficient to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized devices.


**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Microsoft Azure Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Azure does not permit or allow wireless connections in the Azure network environment. Internal security teams regularly scans for rogue wireless signals on a quarterly basis and rogue signals are investigated and removed. Customers are not permitted to deploy wireless technology in the Azure environment. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | Wireless and SNMP are not implemented in the solution.|



### PCI DSS Requirement 11.1.1

**11.1.1** Maintain an inventory of authorized wireless access points including a documented business justification.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Microsoft Azure Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | See "Microsoft Azure" section for [Requirement 11.1](#pci-dss-requirement-11-1). |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | Wireless and SNMP are not implemented in the solution.|



### PCI DSS Requirement 11.1.2

**11.1.2** Implement incident response procedures in the event unauthorized wireless access points are detected.


**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Microsoft Azure Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | See "Microsoft Azure" section for [Requirement 11.1](#pci-dss-requirement-11-1). |
