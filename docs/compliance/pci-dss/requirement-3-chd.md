# CHD requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments
## PCI DSS Requirement 3

**Protect stored cardholder data**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without the proper cryptographic keys, the data is unreadable and unusable to that person. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk mitigation opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing cardholder data unless absolutely necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies, such as e-mail and instant messaging.
Please refer to the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.

## PCI DSS Requirement 3.1

**3.1** Keep cardholder data storage to a minimum by implementing data retention and disposal policies, procedures and processes that include at least the following for all cardholder data (CHD) storage:
- Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal, regulatory, and business requirements
- Specific retention requirements for cardholder data
- Processes for secure deletion of data when no longer needed
- A quarterly process for identifying and securely deleting stored cardholder data that exceeds defined retention.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Azure is responsible for ensuring the customer data designated for deletion are securely decommissioned using NIST 800-88 compliant protocols specified in its Secure Disposal policies. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore does not delete or destroy any stored CHD. However all data is encrypted and no primary account number (PAN) data is stored.<br /><br />|



## PCI DSS Requirement 3.2

**3.2** Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (even if encrypted). If sensitive authentication data is received, render all data unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. 
> - There is a business justification, and 
> - The data is stored securely.
Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3:


**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore does not delete or destroy any stored CHD; the sample data is stored for demo purposes only. However, all data is encrypted and no primary account number (PAN) data is stored.<br /><br />|



### PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1

**3.2.1** Do not store the full contents of any track (from the magnetic stripe located on the back of a card, equivalent data contained on a chip, or elsewhere) after authorization. This data is alternatively called full track, track, track 1, track 2, and magnetic-stripe data. 

> **Note:** In the normal course of business, the following data elements from the magnetic stripe may need to be retained: 
- The cardholder’s name 
- Primary account number (PAN) 
- Expiration date 
- Service code 
>
> To minimize risk, store only these data elements as needed for business.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore does not store the full content of any CHD.|



### PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.2

**3.2.2** Do not store the card verification code or value (three-digit or four-digit number printed on the front or back of a payment card used to verify card-not-present transactions) after authorization.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore encrypts all data including the CVV samples.|



### PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.3

**3.2.3** Do not store the personal identification number (PIN) or the encrypted PIN block after authorization.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore does not store PIN information.|



## PCI DSS Requirement 3.3

**3.3** Mask PAN when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed), such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see the full PAN. 

> **Note:** This requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder data—for example, legal or payment card brand requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore masks the primary account number (PAN) using transparent data encryption, always encrypted columns, and dynamic data masking. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Azure SQL Database](index.md#azure-sql-database).|



## PCI DSS Requirement 3.4

**3.4** Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following approaches:
- One-way hashes based on strong cryptography, (hash must be of the entire PAN)
- Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)
- Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)
- Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures. 

> **Note:** It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity’s environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.

| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore encrypts all credit card data, and uses Azure Key Vault to manage keys, preventing retrieval of CHD.<br /><br />For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Encryption](index.md#encryption-and-secrets-management).|



### PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.1

**3.4.1** If disk encryption is used (rather than file- or column-level database encryption), logical access must be managed separately and independently of native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms (for example, by not using local user account databases or general network login credentials). Decryption keys must not be associated with user accounts. 

> **Note:** This requirement applies in addition to all other PCI DSS encryption and key-management requirements.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore encrypts all stored data, and segregates traffic to prevent privileged elevation for DevOps functions.<br /><br />As the App Service Environment is secured and locked down, there needs to be a mechanism to allow for any DevOps releases or changes that might be necessary, such as the ability to monitor a Web App using Kudu.<br /><br />A virtual machine is established as a jumpbox (bastion host) with the following configurations:<br /><br /><ul><li>[Antimalware extension](/azure/security/azure-security-antimalware)</li><li>[OMS Monitoring extension](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-extensions-oms)</li><li>[VM Diagnostics extension](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-extensions-diagnostics-template)</li><li>[Bitlocker Encrypted Disk](/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption)</li></ul>Using Azure Key Vault aligns with Azure Government, PCI DSS, and HIPAA requirements.|



## PCI DSS Requirement 3.5

**3.5** Document and implement procedures to protect keys used to secure stored cardholder data against disclosure and misuse. 

> **Note:** This requirement applies to keys used to encrypt stored cardholder data, and also applies to key-encrypting keys used to protect data-encrypting keys—such key-encrypting keys must be at least as strong as the data-encrypting key.
