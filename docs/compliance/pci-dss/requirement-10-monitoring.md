# Monitoring requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 10

**Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.

## PCI DSS Requirement 10.1

**10.1** Implement audit trails to link all access to system components to each individual user.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Shared`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure restricts access to administrative and diagnostic tools to authorized personnel with relevant job responsibility. Microsoft Azure restricts privileged access to the tools used in the production environment based on least privilege principles. Microsoft Azure records and maintains a log of all individual user access to Microsoft Azure system components in the platform environment.<br /><br />Microsoft Azure platform components (including OS, CloudNet, Fabric, and so on) are configured to log and collect security events. Administrator activity in the Microsoft Azure platform is logged. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore has extensive logging of all system, and user activity (Including CHD logging). For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Logging](index.md#logging-and-auditing).|



## PCI DSS Requirement 10.2

**10.2** Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events:
- **10.2.1** All individual user accesses to cardholder data
- **10.2.2** All actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges
- **10.2.3** Access to all audit trails
- **10.2.4** Invalid logical access attempts
- **10.2.5** Use of and changes to identification and authentication mechanisms — including but not limited to creation of new accounts and elevation of privileges — and all changes, additions, or deletions to accounts with root or administrative privileges
- **10.2.6** Initialization, stopping, or pausing of the audit logs
- **10.2.7** Creation and deletion of system-level objects
