# Identity requirements for PCI DSS-compliant environments 
## PCI DSS Requirement 8

**Identify and authenticate access to system components**

> **Note:** These requirements are defined by the [Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) as part of the [PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) Version 3.2](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss). Please refer to the PCI DSS for information on testing procedures and guidance for each requirement.

Assigning a unique identification (ID) to each person with access ensures that each individual is uniquely accountable for their actions. When such accountability is in place, actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be traced to, known and authorized users and processes.
The effectiveness of a password is largely determined by the design and implementation of the authentication system—particularly, how frequently password attempts can be made by an attacker, and the security methods to protect user passwords at the point of entry, during transmission, and while in storage.
Note: These requirements are applicable for all accounts, including point-of-sale accounts, with administrative capabilities and all accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data. This includes accounts used by vendors and other third parties (for example, for support or maintenance). These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (e.g., cardholders). 
However, Requirements 8.1.1, 8.2, 8.5, 8.2.3 through 8.2.5, and 8.1.6 through 8.1.8 are not intended to apply to user accounts within a point-of-sale payment application that only have access to one card number at a time in order to facilitate a single transaction (such as cashier accounts).
 
## PCI DSS Requirement 8.1

**8.1** Define and implement policies and procedures to ensure proper user identification management for non-consumer users and administrators on all system components as follows.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |

### PCI DSS Requirement 8.1.3

**8.1.3** Immediately revoke access for any terminated users.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|

**8.1.4** Remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Customer Only`**

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Not applicable. |

|||
|---|---|
| **Provider<br />(Microsoft&nbsp;Azure)** | Microsoft Azure has adopted applicable corporate and organizational security policies, including an Information Security Policy. The policies have been approved, published, and communicated to Microsoft Azure. The Information Security Policy requires that access to Microsoft Azure assets to be granted based on business justification, with the asset owner's authorization and limited based on "need-to-know" and "least-privilege" principles. In addition, the policy also addresses requirements for access management lifecycle including access provisioning, authentication, access authorization, removal of access rights, and periodic access reviews. |
| **Customer<br />(PCI&#8209;DSS&nbsp;Blueprint)** | The Contoso Webstore demo has implemented Azure Active Directory, and Azure Active Directory Role-Based Access control to manage user access to the installation. For more information, see [PCI Guidance - Identity Management](index.md#identity-management).<br /><br />|

### PCI DSS Requirement 8.5.1

**8.5.1** **Additional requirement for service providers only:** Service providers with remote access to customer premises (for example, for support of POS systems or servers) must use a unique authentication credential (such as a password/phrase) for each customer. 
> **Note:** This requirement is not intended to apply to shared hosting providers accessing their own hosting environment, where multiple customer environments are hosted.

**Responsibilities:&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not Applicable`**

|||
|---|---|
