# Media Protection (MP)

## NIST 800-53 Control MP-1

#### Media Protection Policy and Procedures

**MP-1** The organization develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] a media protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and associated media protection controls; and reviews and updates the current media protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and media protection procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

**Responsibilities:** `Customer Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | The customer's enterprise-level  media protection policy and procedures may be sufficient to address this control. <br /> The customer is responsible for developing, documenting, reviewing, updating, and disseminating media protection policy and procedures. Due to there not being any customer-controlled media within the scope of systems deployed on Azure, all media protection controls will be implemented and managed by Azure. However, the customer is still responsible for the appropriate policy and procedure documents. The customer control implementation statement should address the frequency of review, the role(s) responsible, and the fact that there is no customer-controlled media within the scope of Azure and therefore the customer can inherit media protection controls from Azure.  |
