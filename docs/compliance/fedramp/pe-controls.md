# Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)

## NIST 800-53 Control PE-1

#### Physical and Environmental Protection Policy and Procedures

**PE-1** The organization develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] a physical and environmental protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and environmental protection policy and associated physical and environmental protection controls; and reviews and updates the current physical and environmental protection policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and physical and environmental protection procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

**Responsibilities:** `Customer Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | The customer's enterprise-level physical and environmental protection policy and procedures may be sufficient to address this control. <br /> The customer is responsible for developing, documenting, reviewing, updating, and disseminating physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. Due to customers not having physical access to any resources in Azure datacenters, all physical and environmental protection controls will be implemented and managed by Azure. However, the customer is still responsible for the appropriate policy and procedure documents. The customer control implementation statement should address the frequency of review, the role(s) responsible, and the fact that the customer does not have physical access to any Azure resources and therefore the customer can inherit physical and environmental controls from Azure. |
