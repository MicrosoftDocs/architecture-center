| **Customer** | Customers do not have physical access to any system resources in Azure datacenters. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure implements this requirement on behalf of customers. Microsoft Azure has implemented fire protection by installing fire detection and fire suppression systems at the Microsoft Azure datacenters. <br /> Microsoft Azure datacenters implement robust fire detection mechanisms. The Microsoft Azure fire protection approach includes the use of photoelectric smoke detectors installed below the floor and on the ceiling which are integrated with the fire protection sprinkler system. Additionally, there are Xtralis VESDA (Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus) systems in each colocation which monitor the air. VESDA units are highly-sensitive air sampling systems installed throughout multiple high-value spaces. VESDA units allow for an investigative response prior to an actual fire detection alarm. <br /> 'Pull station' fire alarm boxes are installed throughout the datacenters for manual fire alarm notification. Fire extinguishers are located throughout the datacenters and are properly inspected, serviced, and tagged annually. The security staff patrols all building areas multiple times every shift. Datacenter personnel perform a daily site walk-through ensuring all fire watch requirements are being met. <br /> Areas containing sensitive electrical equipment (colocations, MDFs, etc.) are protected by double interlock pre-action (dry pipe) sprinkler systems. Dry pipe sprinklers are a two-stage pre-action system that requires both a sprinkler head activation (due to heat) as well as smoke detection to release water. The sprinkler head activation releases the air pressure in the pipes which allows the pipes to fill with water. Water is released when a smoke or heat detector is also activated. <br /> Fire detection/suppression and emergency lighting systems are wired into the datacenter UPS and generator systems providing for a redundant power source. |

**PE-15** The organization protects the information system from damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation valves that are accessible, working properly, and known to key personnel.

**Responsibilities:** `Azure Only`

|||
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Customers do not have physical access to any system resources in Azure datacenters. |
| **Provider (Microsoft Azure)** | Microsoft Azure implements this requirement on behalf of customers. Microsoft Azure provides water/leak detection in areas with a risk of water leakage (e.g., Air Handlers Units). Fire suppression systems also have leak detection alarms that are monitored. The water/leak detection system is integrated with the facility alarm and notification system. The sprinkler systems in the datacenters are zoned. Datacenter personnel are familiar with emergency procedures requiring the use of the water shutoff valves and their locations. The sprinkler risers have the ability to be shut off individually or as a group via gate valves. All sprinklers in the critical space are double interlock pre-action type sprinklers that require two forms of activation before flow is initiated. The pressure of the sprinkler system is monitored and alarmed against water leakage. |
