# Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) day-2 operations guide

After you release an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)-hosted application, prepare for *day-2 operations*. Day-2 operations include triage, ongoing maintenance of deployed assets, rolling out upgrades, and troubleshooting.

Day-2 operations help you:

- Keep up to date with your service-level agreement (SLA) or service-level objective (SLO) requirements.
- Troubleshoot customer support requests.
- Stay current with the latest platform features and security updates.
- Plan for future growth.

## Prerequisites

The Day-2 operations guide assumes that you've deployed the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) baseline architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks) as an example of a production cluster.
