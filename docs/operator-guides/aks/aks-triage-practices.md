# Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Day 2 Operations Guide

After releasing your Azure Kubernetes Service-hosted application, prepare for _day-2 operations_. The term refers to the ongoing maintainence of the deployed assets and rollout of upgrades. The operations can help you:
- Keep up to date with your service-level agreement (SLA) or Service-level objective (SLO) requirements.
- Troubleshoot customer support requests.
- Stay current with the latest platform features and security updates.
- Plan for future growth. 

## Prerequisites
The best practices for day-2 operations assume that you've deployed the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Baseline](../../reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks.md) architecture as an example of a production cluster. 

## Triage practices

It's often challenging to do root-cause analysis given the different aspects of an AKS cluster. When triaging issues, consider a top-down approach on the cluster hierarchy. Start at the cluster level and drill down if necessary.

In this series, we'll walk you through the thought process of this approach. The articles show examples using a set of tools and dashboards, and how they can highlight some symptoms. 

Common causes addressed in this series include:
- Network and connectivity problems caused by improper configuration.
- Control plane to node communication is broken.
- Kubelet pressures caused by insufficient compute, memory, or storage resources.
- DNS resolution issues.
- Node health is running out of disk IOPS. 
- Admission control pipeline is blocking a large number of requests to the API server.
- The cluster doesn't have permissions to pull from the appropriate container registry.

Itâ€™s not intended to resolve specific issues. For information about troubleshooting specific issues,  [AKS Common Issues](/azure/aks/troubleshooting). 

## In this series

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|[1- Check the AKS cluster health](aks-triage-cluster-health.md)|Start by checking the cluster the health of the overall cluster and networking.|
|[2- Examine the node and pod health](aks-triage-node-health.md) |Check the health of the AKS worker nodes. |
|[3- Check the workload deployments](aks-triage-deployment.md)|Check to see that all deployments and daemonSets are running.|
|[4- Validate the admission controllers](aks-triage-controllers.md)|Check whether the admission controllers are working as expected.|
|[5- Verify the connection to the container registry](aks-triage-container-registry.md)|Verify the connection to the container registry.|
