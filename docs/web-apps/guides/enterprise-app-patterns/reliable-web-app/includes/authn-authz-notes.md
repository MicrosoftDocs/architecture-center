- *Prefer temporary access to storage.* Use temporary permissions to safeguard against unauthorized access and breaches. For example, you can use [shared access signatures (SAS)](/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature) to limit access to a period of time. Use user delegation SAS to maximize security when you grant temporary access. It's the only SAS that uses Microsoft Entra ID credentials and doesn't require a permanent storage account key.

- *Enforce authorization in Azure.* Use [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices) to assign least privileges to user identities. Azure RBAC defines the Azure resources that identities can access, what they can do with those resources, and the areas they have access to.

- *Avoid permanent elevated permissions.* Use [Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) to grant just-in-time access for privileged operations. For example, developers often need administrator-level access to create/delete databases, modify table schemas, and change user permissions. When you use just-in-time access, user identities receive temporary permissions to perform privileged tasks.
