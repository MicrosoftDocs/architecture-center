To successfully move a web app to the cloud, you need to update your web app code with the Retry pattern, Circuit Breaker pattern, and Cache-Aside pattern.

[![Diagram showing the roles of design patterns in the Reliable Web App pattern.](../../../_images/reliable-web-app-design-patterns.svg)](../../../_images/reliable-web-app-design-patterns.svg#lightbox)

*Figure 3. Roles of the design patterns.*

Each design pattern provides workload design benefits that align with one or more pillars of the Well-Architected Framework. Here's an overview of the patterns you should implement:

1. *Retry pattern.* The Retry pattern handles transient failures by retrying operations that might fail intermittently. Implement this pattern on all outbound calls to other Azure services.

1. *Circuit Breaker pattern.* The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from retrying operations that aren't transient. Implement this pattern in all outbound calls to other Azure services.

1. *Cache-Aside pattern.* The Cache-Aside pattern loads data on demand into a cache from a data store. Implement this pattern on requests to the database.
