> [!NOTE]
> [App Service Environment](/azure/app-service/environment/overview) version 3 is the main component of this architecture. Versions 1 and 2 were [retired on August 31, 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/app-service-environment-v1-and-v2-retirement-announcement/).

[Availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) are physically separated collections of datacenters in a given region. Deploying resources across zones ensures that outages that are limited to a zone don't affect the availability of your applications. This architecture shows how you can improve the resiliency of an App Service Environment deployment by deploying it in a zone-redudant architecture. These zones aren't related to proximity. They can map to different physical locations for different subscriptions. The architecture assumes a single-subscription deployment.

Azure services that support availability zones can be zonal, zone redundant, or both. Zonal services can be deployed to a specific zone. Zone-redundant services can be automatically deployed across zones. For detailed guidance and recommendations, see [Availability zone support](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support). App Service Environment supports [zone-redundant deployments](/azure/reliability/reliability-app-service-environment).

When you configure App Service Environment to be zone redundant, the platform automatically deploys instances of the Azure App Service plan in the maximum number of available zones in the selected region. There must be a minimum of two zones available in the region to enable zone redundancy. Therefore, the minimum App Service plan instance count is always two. The platform determines the number of zones available for an App Service Environment.

The resources in the App Service Environment subnets in this reference implementation are the same as the ones in the [standard App Service Environment deployment architecture](./ase-standard-deployment.yml). This reference implementation uses the zone-redundant capabilities of App Service Environment v3 and Azure Cache for Redis to provide higher availability. Note that the scope of this reference architecture is limited to a single region.

### Workflow

This section describes the nature of availability for services used in this architecture:

- [App Service Environment v3](/azure/app-service/environment/overview) can be configured for [zone redundancy](/azure/reliability/reliability-app-service-environment). You can configure zone redundancy at any time during the lifecycle of an App Service Environment in the [regions that support zone redundancy](/azure/app-service/environment/overview#regions). Each App Service plan in a zone-redundant App Service Environment needs to have a minimum of two instances so that they can be deployed in at least two zones and be zone redundant. You can have a mix of zone redundant and non-zone redundant plans if zone redundancy is enabled for the App Service Environment. If you want a specific plan to only have a single instance, you need to disable zone redundancy for that plan first. There is no additional charge for zone redundancy. You only pay for the Isolated v2 instances that use. For more information, see this [pricing guidance](/azure/app-service/environment/overview#pricing). For detailed guidance and recommendations, see [Reliability in App Service Environment](/azure/reliability/reliability-app-service-environment).

- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-network) spans all availability zones that are in a single region. The subnets in the virtual network also cross availability zones. For more information, see [the network requirements for App Service Environment](/azure/app-service/environment/networking#subnet-requirements).

- [Application Gateway v2](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/application-gateway) is zone-redundant. Like the virtual network, it spans multiple availability zones per region. Therefore, a single application gateway is sufficient for a highly available system, as shown in the reference architecture. The reference architecture uses the WAF SKU of Application Gateway, which provides increased protection against common threats and vulnerabilities, based on an implementation of the Core Rule Set (CRS) of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). For more information, see [Scaling Application Gateway v2 and WAF v2](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant).

- [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-firewall/) has built-in support for high availability. It can cross multiple zones without any additional configuration.

  If you need to, you can also configure a specific availability zone when you deploy the firewall. See [Azure Firewall and Availability Zones](/azure/firewall/overview#availability-zones) for more information. (This configuration isn't used in the reference architecture.)

- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/active-directory/) is a highly available, highly redundant global service, spanning availability zones and regions. For more information, see [Advancing Microsoft Entra availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-azure-active-directory-availability/).

- [GitHub Actions](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/pipelines) provides continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities in this architecture. Because App Service Environment is in the virtual network, a virtual machine is used as a jumpbox in the virtual network to deploy apps in the App Service plans. The action builds the apps outside the virtual network. For enhanced security and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity, consider using [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) for the jumpbox.

- [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cache/) is a zone-redundant service. A zone-redundant cache runs on VMs deployed across multiple availability zones. This service provides higher resilience and availability.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/checklist).

#### Jump boxes

This reference implementation uses the same production-level CI/CD pipeline as the standard deployment, with only one jump box VM. You might, however, decide to use one jump box for each of the three zones. This architecture uses just one jump box because the jump box doesn't affect the availability of the app. The jump box is used only for deployment and testing.

#### App Service Environment

You can deploy App Service Environment across availability zones to provide resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads. This configuration is also known as *zone redundancy*.

When you implement zone redundancy, the platform automatically deploys the instances of the App Service plan across two or more zones in the selected region. Therefore, the minimum App Service plan instance count is always two.

- You [configure availability zones](/azure/app-service/environment/configure-zone-redundancy-environment) when you create your App Service Environment, or at any time during the lifecylce of the environment.
- All App Service plans created in that App Service Environment require a minimum of two instances for zone redundancy to be enabled. You can selectively enable and disable zone redundancy for the individual App Service plans as long as the App Service Environment is zone redundant. To scale-in an App Service plan to a single instance, first disable zone redundancy for that plan, and then proceed with the scale-in operation.
- Availability zones are supported only in a [subset of regions](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

For more information, see [Reliability in Azure App Service](/azure/reliability/reliability-app-service-environment).

#### Resiliency

The applications that run in App Service Environment form the [backend pool](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-components#backend-pools) for Application Gateway. When a request to the application comes from the public internet, the gateway forwards the request to the application running in App Service Environment. This reference architecture implements [health checks](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-3.1) within the main web frontend, `votingApp`. This health probe checks whether the web API and the Redis cache are healthy. You can see the code that implements this probe in [Startup.cs](https://github.com/mspnp/app-service-environments-ILB-deployments/blob/master/code/web-app-ri/VotingWeb/Startup.cs):

```dotnetcli
var uriBuilder = new UriBuilder(Configuration.GetValue<string>("ConnectionEndpoints:VotingDataAPIBaseUri"))
{
    Path = "/health"
};

services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddUrlGroup(uriBuilder.Uri, timeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15))
    .AddRedis(Configuration.GetValue<string>("ConnectionEndpoints:RedisConnectionEndpoint"));
```

The following code shows how the [commands_ha.azcli](https://github.com/mspnp/app-service-environments-ILB-deployments/blob/master/deployment/commands_ha.azcli) script configures the backend pools and the health probe for the application gateway:

```bash
# Generates parameters file for appgw script
cat <<EOF > appgwApps.parameters.json
[
  {
    "name": "votapp",
    "routingPriority": 100,
    "hostName": "${APPGW_APP1_URL}",
    "backendAddresses": [
      {
        "fqdn": "${INTERNAL_APP1_URL}"
      }
    ],
    "probePath": "/health"
  }
]
```

If any of the components (the web frontend, the API, or the cache) fails the health probe, Application Gateway routes the request to the other application in the backend pool. This configuration ensures that the request is always routed to the application in a completely available App Service Environment subnet.

The health probe is also implemented in the standard reference implementation. There, the gateway simply returns an error if the health probe fails. However, the highly available implementation improves the resiliency of the application and the quality of the user experience.

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

The cost considerations for the high availability architecture are similar to those of the standard deployment.

The following differences can affect the cost:

- There's no additional charge for availability zone support. You only pay for the instances you use. For more information, see [App Service Environment pricing](/azure/app-service/environment/overview#pricing).
- Azure Cache for Redis is also a zone-redundant service. A zone-redundant cache runs on VMs that are deployed across multiple availability zones to provide higher resilience and availability. There are additional charges associated with zone redundancy to support the data transfer between zones.

The tradeoff for a highly available, resilient, and highly secure system is increased cost for some Azure services. Use the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to evaluate your needs with respect to pricing.

## Next steps

You can modify this architecture by horizontally scaling your applications, within the same region or across several regions, based on the expected peak load capacity. Replicating your applications on multiple regions might help mitigate the risks of wider geographical datacenter failures, like those caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters. To learn more about horizontal scaling, see [Geo Distributed Scale with App Service Environments](/azure/app-service/environment/app-service-app-service-environment-geo-distributed-scale). For a global and highly available routing solution, consider using [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview).
