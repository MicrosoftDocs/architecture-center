# Icons and diagrams

These resources include icons, Viso templates, PNG files, and SVG files that are useful for producing your own architecture diagrams.

## Microsoft Azure, Cloud and Enterprise Symbol/Icon Set

The symbol/icon set is a collection of Visio, PowerPoint, PNG, and SVG assets that you can use to produce custom technical content.
[View the training video](http://aka.ms/CnESymbolsVideo) and [download symbol/icon set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols).

Additional symbols for Microsoft Office and related technologies are available in the [Microsoft Office Visio stencil](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35772). They are not optimized for architectural diagrams.

## Reference Architectures Visio template 

A version of the diagrams used in the [Reference Architectures](../reference-architectures/index.md) is available for [download in Visio format](https://aka.ms/arch-diagrams).

## Solution Architecture icons

Microsoft publishes [solution architectures and accompanying diagrams](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/architecture/). The diagrams are in downloadable in SVG format. SVG can be opened and then modified by many tools, including Visio and PowerPoint. If you upgroup the diagram, you can get at the individual icons.  To download a diagram, right-click on it and choose "Save As". You should see an option to save as SVG. If you do not see this option, try again with a different browser. 

## 3D Blueprint Visio template

A Visio template is avaliable for producing 3D (isometric) architectural diagrams.
