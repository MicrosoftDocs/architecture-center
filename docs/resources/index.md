# Additional resources for producing your own architecture diagrams

This article lists resources for building applications that use Microsoft Azure. It includes tools to visually draw and describe software systems.

## Cloud & Enterpirse symbol and icon sets

[View the Visio and symbols training video](http://aka.ms/CnESymbolsVideo) and then [download the Cloud and Enterprise Symbol set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols) to help create technical materials that describe Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server and more. 

- architecture diagrams 
- training materials 
- presentations 
- datasheets 
- infographics 
- whitepapers 
- third-party books, if the book trains people to use Microsoft products.

The symbols are not meant for use in user interfaces, but you can request permission.  The Azures ones are okay to use. That is, if you use them to represent the same objects in the same way as in the Azure portal.  For example, the symbol for Azure Service Bus should be used to represent and access only Azure Service Bus objects. 

Third-party symbols are not owned by Microsoft. Look to those companies web sites for rules on the use of their icons.

The Cloud & Enterpirse (CnE) symbols are in Visio, SVG, and PNG format. Additional instructions on how to use the symbols in PowerPoint are included in the set. The symbol set ships quarterly and is updated as new services are released.

Additional symbols for Microsoft Office and related technologies are available in the [Microsoft Office Visio stencil](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35772). They are not optimized for architectural diagrams.   

Send email to [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com) for specific questions and feedback.

## Visio templates for Reference Architectures

A version of the diagrams used in the [Reference Architectures](../reference-architectures/index.md) is available for [download in Visio format](https://aka.ms/arch-diagrams).

## 3D Blueprint Visio template

The 3D versions of the now defunct [Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://aka.ms/azblueprints) were initially created in a non-Microsoft tool. A Visio 2013 (and later) template shipped on August 5, 2015 as part of a [Microsoft Architecture certification course distributed on EDX.ORG](#microsoft-architecture-certification-course).

The template is also available outside the course.

* [View the training video](http://aka.ms/3dBlueprintTemplateVideo) first so you know what it can do   
* Download the [Microsoft 3d Blueprint Visio Template](http://aka.ms/3DBlueprintTemplate)
* Download the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937) to use with the 3D template. 

Email us at [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com) for specific questions not answered by the training materials or to give feedback. The template is no longer under active development. However, it is still useful and relevant because it can use any PNG or the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols), which are updated.

## Microsoft architecture certification course

Microsoft created an architecture course in August 2015 supporting Microsoft certification exam 70-534. It's [available for free on EDX.ORG](https://www.edx.org/course/architecting-microsoft-azure-solutions-microsoft-dev205x).  It uses the [3D Blueprint Visio Template](#3d-blueprint-visio-template).

## Architecture Infographics

Microsoft publishes several architecture-related posters/infographics. They include [Building Real-World Cloud Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/building-real-world-cloud-apps/) and [Scaling with Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/cloud-services/).
