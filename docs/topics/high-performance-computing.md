<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

High-performance computing (HPC), also called "big compute", uses a large number of CPU or GPU-based computers to solve complex mathematical tasks.

Many industries use HPC to solve some of their most difficult problems.  These include workloads such as:

- Genomics
- Oil and gas simulations
- Finance
- Semiconductor design
- Engineering
- Weather modeling

### How is HPC different on the cloud?

One of the primary differences between an on-premises HPC system and one in the cloud is the ability for resources to dynamically be added and removed as they're needed.  Dynamic scaling removes compute capacity as a bottleneck and instead allow customers to right size their infrastructure for the requirements of their jobs.

The following articles provide more detail about this dynamic scaling capability.

- [Big Compute Architecture Style](../guide/architecture-styles/big-compute.yml)
- [Autoscaling best practices](../best-practices/auto-scaling.md)

## Implementation checklist

As you're looking to implement your own HPC solution on Azure, ensure you're reviewed the following topics:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Choose the appropriate [architecture](#infrastructure) based on your requirements
> - Know which [compute](#compute) options is right for your workload
> - Identify the right [storage](#storage) solution that meets your needs
> - Decide how you're going to [manage](#management) all your resources
> - Optimize your [application](#hpc-applications) for the cloud
> - [Secure](#security) your Infrastructure

## Infrastructure

There are many infrastructure components that are necessary to build an HPC system. Compute, storage, and networking provide the underlying components, no matter how you choose to manage your HPC workloads.

### Compute

Azure offers a range of sizes that are optimized for both CPU & GPU intensive workloads.

#### CPU-based virtual machines

- [Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc)
- [Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-hpc)

#### GPU-enabled virtual machines

N-series VMs feature NVIDIA GPUs designed for compute-intensive or graphics-intensive applications including artificial intelligence (AI) learning and visualization.

- [Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)
- [Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu)

### Storage

Large-scale Batch and HPC workloads have demands for data storage and access that exceed the capabilities of traditional cloud file systems. There are many solutions that manage both the speed and capacity needs of HPC applications on Azure:

- [Azure NetApp Files](/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction)
- [Storage Optimized Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-storage)
- [Blob, table, and queue storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction)
- [Azure SMB File storage](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction)
- [Azure Managed Lustre](/azure/azure-managed-lustre/amlfs-overview)

For more information comparing Lustre, GlusterFS, and BeeGFS on Azure, review the [Parallel Files Systems on Azure](/archive/blogs/azurecat/azurecat-ebook-parallel-virtual-file-systems-on-microsoft-azure) e-book and the [Lustre on Azure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azurecat/lustre-on-azure/ba-p/1052536) blog.

### Networking

H16r, H16mr, A8, and A9 VMs can connect to a high throughput back-end RDMA network. This network can improve the performance of tightly coupled parallel applications running under Microsoft Message Passing Interface better known as MPI or Intel MPI.

- [RDMA Capable Instances](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-hpc#rdma-capable-instances)
- [Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)
- [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)

## Management

### Do-it-yourself

Building an HPC system from scratch on Azure offers a significant amount of flexibility, but it is often very maintenance intensive.

1. Set up your own cluster environment in Azure virtual machines or [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).
2. Use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy leading [workload managers](#workload-managers), infrastructure, and [applications](#hpc-applications).
3. Choose HPC and GPU [VM sizes](#compute) that include specialized hardware and network connections for MPI or GPU workloads.
4. Add [high-performance storage](#storage) for I/O-intensive workloads.

### Hybrid and cloud Bursting

If you have an existing on-premises HPC system that you'd like to connect to Azure, there are several resources to help get you started.

First, review the [Options for connecting an on-premises network to Azure](../reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/index.yml) article in the documentation.  From there, you can find additional information on these connectivity options:

                </div>
            </article>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

Once network connectivity is securely established, you can start using cloud compute resources on-demand with the bursting capabilities of your existing [workload manager](#workload-managers).

### Marketplace solutions

There are many workload managers offered in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace).

- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for HPC](https://www.suse.com/products/server/hpc/)
- [TIBCO DataSynapse GridServer](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/tibco-software.tibco_datasynapse_gridserver)
- [Azure Data Science VM for Windows and Linux](/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)

- [UberCloud](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/ubercloud.ansys_182_test)

### Azure Batch

[Azure Batch](/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview) is a platform service for running large-scale parallel and HPC applications efficiently in the cloud. Azure Batch schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed pool of virtual machines, and can automatically scale compute resources to meet the needs of your jobs.

SaaS providers or developers can use the Batch SDKs and tools to integrate HPC applications or container workloads with Azure, stage data to Azure, and build job execution pipelines.

In Azure Batch all the services are running on the Cloud, the image below shows how the architecture looks with Azure Batch, having the scalability and job schedule configurations running in the Cloud while the results and reports can be sent to your on-premises environment.

![Diagram shows example HPC architecture for Azure Batch.](images/cloud-native-job-scheduler-azure-batch.jpg)


### Azure CycleCloud

[Azure CycleCloud](/azure/cyclecloud) Provides the simplest way to manage HPC workloads using any scheduler (like Slurm, Grid Engine, HPC Pack, HTCondor, LSF, PBS Pro, or Symphony), on Azure

CycleCloud allows you to:

- Deploy full clusters and other resources, including scheduler, compute VMs, storage, networking, and cache
- Orchestrate job, data, and cloud workflows
- Give admins full control over which users can run jobs, as well as where and at what cost
- Customize and optimize clusters through advanced policy and governance features, including cost controls, Active Directory integration, monitoring, and reporting
- Use your current job scheduler and applications without modification
- Take advantage of built-in autoscaling and battle-tested reference architectures for a wide range of HPC workloads and industries

##### Hybrid / cloud bursting model
In this Hybrid example diagram, we can see clearly how these services are distributed between the cloud and the on-premises environment. Having the opportunity to run jobs in both workloads.
![Diagram shows example HPC architecture for CycleCloud on Azure in a Hybrid.](images/industry-standard-high-performance-computing-job-scheduler-hybrid-cloudbursting-model-azure-cyclecloud.jpg)

##### Cloud native model
The cloud native model example diagram below, shows how the workload in the cloud will handle everything while still conserving the connection to the on-premises environment.
