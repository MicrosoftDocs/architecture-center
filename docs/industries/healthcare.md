# Solutions for the healthcare industry

The healthcare industry includes various systems that provide curative, preventative, rehabilitative, and palliative care to patients. Proper management of these systems enables healthcare providers and managers provide high-quality care and treatment for their patients. With Azure cloud and other Microsoft services, you can now create highly efficient and resilient healthcare systems that take care of not only the patient-provider interactions, but also provide clinical and data insights, leading to a more patient-centric strategy for the healthcare institute.

Modernization and digital transformation of healthcare facilities is all the more important during the current COVID-19 global pandemic.
