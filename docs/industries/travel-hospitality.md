# Solutions for the travel and hospitality industry

Travel and hospitality are trillion-dollar industries in the United States alone. Travel and hospitality companies are investing in newer products and technologies, looking for that competitive edge. Cloud technology offers innovative, affordable, and versatile solutions. With integrated solutions, services, and templates, Azure gives developers and IT professionals the ability to create web solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices.

Azure has the flexibility and scalability to handle the challenges that are faced in the travel and hospitality industries.  Azure offers the following capabilities:

- Create hybrid environments by integrating your existing IT environment with the cloud, through secure private connections, hybrid databases, and storage solutions. Keep your assets where you want them.
- Increase or lower storage volume based on seasonal fluctuations and high-demand events. Scale to the demands of your travelers.
- Keep data secure and safe through encrypted solutions, firewalls, backup recovery, and redundancy.
- Build, deploy, and manage apps.  Customize your cloud software to meet your needs.
- Improve customer service and uncover new business opportunities by using built-in support for analyzing data and key insights.
