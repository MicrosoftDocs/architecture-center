# Solutions for the aerospace industry

Intelligent cloud analytics, AI and machine learning, speech capabilities, and improved security are just some of the benefits that aerospace enterprises gain by using Azure.

Airbus is a leader in designing, manufacturing, and servicing commercial and military aircraft, helicopters, satellites, and launch vehicles. Watch this [video to learn how they use AI to improve pilot training and satellite operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRprKorsDFQ).

Airbus also uses Azure to fine-tune processes for designing, building, and operating complex products. Watch [How Airbus is transforming aerospace with Microsoft Azure Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5kuKEfKkkg) to learn more.

In the following video, you can learn about the Microsoft partnership with SpaceX that brings worldwide satellite connectivity to cloud services:
