# Solutions for the telecommunications industry 

Transform how cloud and edge work together to capitalize on the new service opportunities enabled by 5G. Connect your customers to the right products and services. Use AI, automation, and advanced analytics to realize efficiencies, avoid service disruptions, and drive down costs. To learn more, check out this article, which provides an overview of architectures and ideas for using Azure services to build solutions for the telecommunications industry. 

In this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEy4ngn1kCI), Satya Nadella talks about [Azure for operators](https://azure.microsoft.com/industries/telecommunications), the Microsoft hybrid cloud solutions that can help service providers deploy, secure, and monetize network services across Azure and other platforms in a multi-cloud environment. 

This video describes how Microsoft enables telecommunications organizations to achieve more:
