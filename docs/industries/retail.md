# Solutions for retail industry

Retail is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide, generating some of the biggest revenues and accounting to almost a third of American jobs. The core of retail industry is selling products and services to consumers, through channels such as, storefront, catalog, television, and online. Retailers can enhance or reimagine their customer's journey using Microsoft Azure services by:

- keeping their supply chains agile and efficient,
- unlocking new opportunities with data and analytics,
- creating innovative customer experiences using mixed reality, AI, and IoT, and
- building a personalized and secure multi-channel retail experience for customers.

Using Azure services, retailers can easily achieve these goals. For use cases and customer stories, visit [Azure for retail](https://azure.microsoft.com/industries/retailers/). Microsoft is also revolutionizing the retail industry, by providing a comprehensive retail package, [Microsoft Cloud for Retail](https://www.microsoft.com/industry/retail/microsoft-cloud-for-retail).
