# Azure architecture icons

Customers and partners are permitted by Microsoft to use the Azure icons to create architecture diagrams. They are designed as a family and are simple and accessible. The icons can also be used in training manuals or documentation about a Microsoft product. The full name of the icon must always be used in proximity to the icon, but never locked to appear like a logo.

### Do’s

* Use the icon to illustrate how products can work together
* In diagrams, make sure to include the product name somewhere close to the icon
* In text, at first mention use the full product name:  Microsoft Azure (insert name)

### Don’ts

* Never put the product name so close to the icon that it appears to be a logo
* Don’t crop, flip or rotate icons
* Don’t distort or change icon shape in any way
* Don’t use Microsoft product icons to represent your product or service
