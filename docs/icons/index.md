# Download Azure icons to use in architecture diagrams and documentation

This page provides an official collection of Azure architecture icons including Azure product icons to help you build a custom architecture diagram for your next solution. Helping our customers design solutions is core to the Azure Architecture Center's mission. Architecture diagrams like those included in Azure guidance can help communicate design decisions and the relationships between components of a given workload.

To learn more about communicating design intent, see [Architecture design diagrams](/azure/well-architected/architect-role/design-diagrams) in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

## General guidelines

### Do's

- Use the icon to illustrate how products can work together.
- In diagrams, we recommend including the product name somewhere close to the icon.
- Use the icons as they would appear within Azure.

### Don'ts

- Don't crop, flip, or rotate icons.
- Don't distort or change icon shape in any way.
- Don't use Microsoft product icons to represent your product or service.
