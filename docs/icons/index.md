# Azure architecture icons

Helping our customers design and architect new solutions is core to the Azure Architecture Center's mission. Architecture diagrams like those included in our guidance can help communicate design decisions and the relationships between components of a given workload. On this page you'll find an official collection of Azure architecture icons including Azure product icons to help you build a custom architecture diagram for your next solution.

## General guidelines

### Do's

- Use the icon to illustrate how products can work together.
- In diagrams, we recommend including the product name somewhere close to the icon.
- Use the icons as they would appear within Azure.

### Don'ts

- Don't crop, flip or rotate icons.
- Don't distort or change icon shape in any way.
- Don't use Microsoft product icons to represent your product or service.
