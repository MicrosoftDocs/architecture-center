# Azure architecture icons

Helping our customers design and architect new solutions is core to the Azure Architecture Center's mission. Architecture diagrams like those included in our guidance can help communicate design decisions and the relationships between components of a given workload. On this page you will find an official collection of Azure architecture icons including Azure product icons to help you build a custom architecture diagram for your next solution.

### Do's

* Use the icon to illustrate how products can work together
* In diagrams, we recommend to include the product name somewhere close to the icon
* Use the icons as they would appear within Azure

### Don'ts

* Don't crop, flip or rotate icons
* Don't distort or change icon shape in any way
* Don't use Microsoft product icons to represent your product or service

The files in the icons folder are the same except there is no longer a CXP folder. If you encounter any issues, let us know.

### January 2021

There are ~26 icons that have been added to the existing set. The download file name has been updated to Azure_Public_Service_Icons_V4.zip

## Icon terms

Microsoft permits the use of these icons in architectural diagrams, training materials, or documentation. You may copy, distribute, and display the icons only for the permitted use unless granted explicit permission by Microsoft. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
