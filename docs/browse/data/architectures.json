On a single machine, the process of generating a video file from static assets can take hours or even days depending on the length and complexity of the video you are producing. Many companies will purchase either expensive high end desktop computers to perform these tasks, or invest in large render farms that they can submit jobs to. However, by taking advantage of Azure Batch, that power is available to you when you need it and shuts itself down when you don't, all without any capital investment.</p>\n<p>Batch gives you a consistent management experience and job scheduling, whether you select Windows Server or Linux compute nodes. With Batch, you can use your existing Windows or Linux applications, including AutoDesk Maya and Blender, to run large-scale render jobs in Azure.</p>",

These insights generate <strong>actions</strong> to improve a business or process. An example is an engine (the thing) sending temperature data. This data is used to evaluate whether the engine is performing as expected (the insight). The insight is used to proactively prioritize the maintenance schedule for the engine (the action).</p>\n<p>This reference architecture uses Azure PaaS (platform-as-a-service) components. Another recommended option for building IoT solutions on Azure is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/\">Azure IoT Central</a>. IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution. It abstracts the technical choices and lets you focus on your solution exclusively. This simplicity comes with a tradeoff in being less customizable than a PaaS-based solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At a high level, there are two ways to process telemetry data, hot path and cold path. The difference has to do with requirements for latency and data access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>hot path</strong> analyzes data in near-real-time, as it arrives. In the hot path, telemetry must be processed with very low latency. The hot path is typically implemented using a stream processing engine. The output may trigger an alert, or be written to a structured format that can be queried using analytical tools.</li>\n<li>The <strong>cold path</strong> performs batch processing at longer intervals (hourly or daily). The cold path typically operates over large volumes of data, but the results don't need to be as timely as the hot path. In the cold path, raw telemetry is captured and then fed into a batch process.</li>\n</ul>",

Designing and implementing a consistent and reliable backup approach in a hybrid environment is challenging, but can be considerably simplified through integration with services provided by Microsoft Azure. This applies not only to the workloads running on traditional on-premises infrastructure, but also to those hosted by third-party public and private cloud providers. However, benefits of integration with Azure cloud services are particularly evident when the hybrid environments incorporate Azure Stack portfolio offerings, including the Azure Stack Hub.</p>\n<p>While one of the primary strengths of Azure Stack Hub is its support for the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, it also helps customers to modernize their existing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) workloads. Such workloads might include file shares, Microsoft SQL Server databases, Microsoft SharePoint farms, and Microsoft Exchange Server clusters. Migrating them to VMs running on hyperconverged, highly-resilient clusters, with administrative and programming models consistent with Microsoft Azure, results in minimized management and maintenance overhead.</p>\n<p>For implementing backup of files and applications running on Azure Hub Stack VMs, Microsoft recommends a hybrid approach that relies on a combination of cloud and on-premises components to deliver a scalable, performant, resilient, secure, straightforward to manage, and cost-efficient backup solution. The central component of this solution is Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) v3, which is part of the Azure Backup offering. MABS relies on Azure Stack Hub infrastructure for compute, network, and short-term storage resources, while it leverages Azure-based storage to serve as the long-term backup store. This minimizes or eliminates the need to maintain physical backup media such as tapes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!Note]\nMABS is based on Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) and provides similar functionality with just a few differences. However, DPM is not supported for use with Azure Stack Hub.</p>\n</blockquote>",

While there are other ways to build such a system, the solution described has been successful in enabling communication between patients and their remote care provider, as well as remotely tuning the medical devices that patients carry.</p>\n<p>There are about 700 million people who suffer from hearing disabilities. However, only 10% of them use hearing aid devices to improve their lives. In some geographies or situations, it is impossible for a patient to get direct assistance when needed. For example, consider patients who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need help in a specific hearing situation (for example, while walking in the park, attending a party, or being at home), which cannot be reproduced in the hearing care professional's office.</li>\n<li>Have mobility issues or reside long distances from their hearing care professional.</li>\n<li>Live in an emerging country/region that has a limited number of hearing care professionals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To overcome these difficulties, it is important to have the ability to provide hearing care services remotely. In this case, the healthcare professional uses chat or video communication to engage with their remote patients. People who are hard of hearing use a smartphone to allow access to the hearing aid device during the remote session. The patient immediately experiences improved hearing as the hearing care professional deploys changes to the configuration of the hearing aid device in real time.</p>",

            "Summary": "<p>This example scenario demonstrates how end manufacturers can connect their assets to the cloud using OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) and the Industrial Components. They can monitor their equipment's key parameters to discover anomalies before they become critical issues. OPC UA is a platform-independent and service-oriented interoperability standard for a secure and reliable data exchange. OPC UA is used by various industrial systems and devices such as industry PCs, PLCs, and sensors. It's a standard that is driven by the OPC Foundation.</p>",
            "Flow": {
                "FlowStep_A": "Industrial devices that can natively communicate OPC UA can directly connect to IoT Edge. IoT Edge is the compute power that sits on your on-premises network. It\u2019s the runtime environment of the Industrial Modules (OPC Publisher, OPC Twin, and Discovery Module). Modules are containers that run Azure services, 3rd party services, or your own code. The OPC Publisher module connects to OPC UA servers and publishes OPC UA telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub. OPC Twin creates a digital twin of an OPC UA server in the cloud and provides OPC UA browse/read/write/method call capabilities via a cloud-based REST (Representational State Transfer) interface. The Discovery module provides discovery services on the edge, which include OPC UA server discovery.",
                "FlowStep_B": "Industrial devices that can\u2019t communicate through OPC UA need a 3rd party PLC adapter to connect to IoT Edge. Adapters are obtainable as modules in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/).",
                "FlowStep_C": "The 3rd party PLC adapters enable a connectivity between the devices and IoT Edge.",
                "FlowStep_D": "For analytical capabilities closer to where the data originates, there are modules like Machine Learning on Edge or Functions obtainable from the Azure Marketplace, allowing low latency and operation in disconnected state.",
                "FlowStep_E": "Azure IoT Hub connects the devices virtually to the cloud for further data processing. It enables a security-enhanced bidirectional communication between IoT applications and devices.",
                "FlowStep_F": "The Industrial Services are made up of several microservices exposing a REST API. All Industrial Services are deployed to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. They implement business logic and functionality for discovery, registration, remote control, and post-processing telemetry of industrial devices. The REST APIs can be used in any programming language and framework that can call an HTTP endpoint.",
                "FlowStep_G": "Azure Event Hubs transforms and stores the data. It provides a distributed stream processing platform with low latency and seamless integration.",
                "FlowStep_H": "_Alternative 1:_ Store and analyze the data using Azure Time Series Insights (TSI). The telemetry processor in the Industrial IoT platform forwards contextualized samples to TSI and other consumers.",
                "FlowStep_I": "The Time Series Insights Explorer is a web application you can use to visualize the telemetry.",
                "FlowStep_J": "_Alternative 2:_ After the Industrial Services process the data, Azure Data Lake stores and further analyzes the data. Azure Data Lake is a massively scalable data lake with enterprise-grade security and auditing, which allows batch, stream and interactive analytic programs to run with simplicity. Azure Data Lake solves many of the productivity and scalability challenges that prevent you from maximizing the value of your data assets.",
                "FlowStep_K": "Explore your data with visual reports and collaborate, publish and share them with others. Power BI integrates with other tools, including Microsoft Excel, so you can get up to speed quickly and work seamlessly with your existing solutions.",
                "FlowStep_L": "_Alternative 3:_ Azure Stream Analytics is a real time analytics service. It\u2019s easily extensible with custom code and built-in machine learning capabilities for more advanced scenarios.",
                "FlowStep_M": "Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, which allows you to run small pieces of code (called \"functions\") without worrying about application infrastructure. With Azure Functions, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date servers you need to keep your application running at scale.",
                "FlowStep_N": "Azure Notification Hubs allow you to send notifications to a wide range of mobile platforms and can allow notification of operators and administrators on certain events or alerts which require immediate attention."

In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and protocols are lightweight. Microservices offer benefits such as clear separation of concerns and decoupling of dependencies.</p>\n<p>Microservices introduce complexities in the development cycle compared to traditional monolithic applications. Traditionally, development occurs in a local or virtual replica of the application stack, which configures and runs compute and storage components locally in isolation. In a microservice model, developers need to test their services against the existing architecture, catch integration issues early to save on build and deployment time, and keep integrated builds clean over the lifecycle of the application.</p>\n<p><em>Development testing (DevTest)</em> is a software development approach that integrates testing early in the development phase to speed development. <em>DevOps</em> is a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations to shorten the development cycle and provide high-quality continuous delivery. <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployments.</p>\n<p>This solution architecture models a development and deployment environment that uses DevOps in DevTest for rapid iterative development of an <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/\">Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a> microservice application. </p>",

The solution consists of a configuration server and process server components runing on an Azure Stack Hub VM. These components are capable of protecting both Windows Server VMs running such workloads as SQL Server or Sharepoint Server, as well as CentOS and Ubuntu Linux VMs. The Azure components of the solution include an geo-redundant Azure Recovery Services vault handling orchestration tasks and an Azure Storage account serving as the destination of the replication traffic originating from the Azure Stack Hub VMs.\" src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/hybrid/images/azure-stack-vm-dr.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>Download a <a href=\"https://arch-center.azureedge.net/azure-stack-vm-dr.vsdx\">Visio file</a> of this architecture.</em></p>\n<p>Azure Stack Hub includes self-healing functionality, providing auto-remediation in a range of scenarios involving localized failures of its components. However, large-scale failures, including outages affecting server racks or site-level disasters, require additional considerations. These considerations should be part of the business continuity and disaster recovery strategy for VM-based user workloads. This strategy must also account for recovery of the Azure Stack infrastructure, which is separate from workload recovery.</p>\n<p>Traditional, on-premises workload recovery solutions are complex to configure, expensive and labor-intensive to maintain, and challenging to automate, especially when using another on-premises location as the failover site. Microsoft recommends an alternative solution that relies on a combination of the cloud and on-premises components to deliver resilient, performance-based, highly automated, and straightforward ways to manage, secure, and achieve a cost-efficient disaster recovery strategy. The core element of this solution is the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services offering, with the failover site residing in Azure.</p>\n<p>Azure Site Recovery with Azure as the failover site eliminates all of these drawbacks. You can use its capabilities to protect both physical and virtual servers, including those running on either Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware ESXi virtualization platforms. You also have the option to leverage the same capabilities to facilitate recovery of workloads running on Azure Stack Hub VMs.</p>",

            "Summary": "<p>This reference architecture shows how to conduct distributed training of deep learning models across clusters of GPU-enabled VMs. The scenario is image classification, but the solution can be generalized for other deep learning scenarios such as segmentation and object detection.</p>\n<p>A reference implementation for this architecture is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/DistributedDeepLearning\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Architecture for distributed deep learning\" src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/_images/distributed_dl_architecture.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: Classifying images is a widely applied technique in computer vision, often tackled by training a convolutional neural network (CNN). For particularly large models with large datasets, the training process can take weeks or months on a single GPU. In some situations, the models are so large that it's not possible to fit reasonable batch sizes onto the GPU. Using distributed training in these situations can shorten the training time.</p>\n<p>In this specific scenario, a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">ResNet50 CNN model</a> is trained using <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/horovod\">Horovod</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org\">Imagenet dataset</a> and on synthetic data. The reference implementation shows how to accomplish this task using TensorFlow.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to train a deep learning model in a distributed fashion, including data-parallel and model-parallel approaches based on synchronous or asynchronous updates. Currently the most common scenario is data parallel with synchronous updates. This approach is the easiest to implement and is sufficient for most use cases.</p>\n<p>In data-parallel distributed training with synchronous updates, the model is replicated across <em>n</em> hardware devices. A mini-batch of training samples is divided into <em>n</em> micro-batches. Each device performs the forward and backward passes for a micro-batch. When a device finishes the process, it shares the updates with the other devices. These values are used to calculate the updated weights of the entire mini-batch, and the weights are synchronized across the models. This scenario is covered in the <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/DistributedDeepLearning\">GitHub</a> repository.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Data parallel distributed training\" src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/_images/distributed_dl_flow.png\" /></p>\n<p>This architecture can also be used for model-parallel and asynchronous updates. In model-parallel distributed training, the model is divided across <em>n</em> hardware devices, with each device holding a part of the model. In the simplest implementation, each device may hold a layer of the network, and information is passed between devices during the forward and backwards pass. Larger neural networks can be trained this way, but at the cost of performance, since devices are constantly waiting for each other to complete either the forward or backwards pass. Some advanced techniques try to partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic gradients.</p>\n<p>The steps for training are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create scripts that will run on the cluster and train your model, then transfer them to file storage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write the data to Premium Blob Storage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace. This will also create an Azure Container Registry to host your Docker Images.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create an Azure Machine Learning GPU Cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Submit jobs. For each job with unique dependencies, a new Docker image is built and pushed to your container registry. During execution, the appropriate Docker image runs and executes your script.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All the results and logs will be written to Blob storage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

The Event Grid monitors resource creation events, and then calls an [Azure function](/azure/azure-functions/). The function interacts with Azure Active Directory, and validates the cost center ID for the new resource. If different, it updates the tag and sends out an email to the resource owner. The REST queries for Azure Active Directory are mocked out for simplicity. Azure AD can also be integrated using the [Azure AD PowerShell module](/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0) or the [ADAL for Python library](https://pypi.org/project/adal/)."

Azure Firewall bases packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports, or on application-based HTTP(S) or SQL attributes. Azure Firewall also leverages Microsoft threat intelligence to identify malicious IP addresses.

Application Gateway also uses Web Application Firewall to inspect web traffic and detect attacks at the HTTP layer.

N-tier architectures are typically implemented as IaaS apps divided into logical layers and physical tiers, with a top web or presentation tier, a middle business tier, and a data tier. </p>\n<p>In an IaaS n-tier app, each tier runs on a separate set of VMs. The web and business tiers are stateless, meaning any VM in the tier can handle any request for that tier. The data tier is a replicated database, object storage, or file storage. Multiple VMs in each tier provide resiliency if one VM fails, and load balancers distribute requests across the VMs. </p>\n<p>You can scale out tiers by adding more VMs to the pools, and use <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview\">virtual machine scale sets</a> to automatically scale out identical VMs. Because you use load balancers, you can scale out tiers without affecting app uptime.</p>\n<p>If the service-level agreement (SLA) for an IaaS app requires &gt; 99% availability, you can place VMs in <em>availability sets</em>, <em>availability zones</em>, and <em>proximity placement groups</em> to configure high availability for the app. The HA and DR solutions you choose depend on the required SLA, latency considerations, and regional DR requirements.</p>",

In circuit-board manufacturing, faulty boards can cost manufacturers money and productivity. Assembly lines rely on human operators to quickly review and validate boards flagged as potentially faulty by assembly-line test machines.</p>\n<p>This solution analyzes electronic component images generated by assembly-line cameras in a circuit-board manufacturing plant and detects their error status. The goal is to minimize or remove the need for human intervention. The solution builds an image classification system using a convolutional neural network with 50 hidden layers, pretrained on 350,000 images in an ImageNet dataset to generate visual features of the images by removing the last network layer. These features are then used to train a boosted decision tree to classify the image as \"pass\" or \"fail\" and final scoring conducted on edge machines at the plant. The classification performance results are good (time-based cross-validation AUC&gt;.90) which indicates the solution is suitable to drastically minimize human intervention for electronic-components failure detection in assembled circuit boards.</p>\n<p>Using this solution to automate failure detection instead of relying solely on human operators helps improve the identification of faulty electronic components and boost productivity.</p>",

            "Summary": "<p>Social sites, forums, and other text-heavy Q&amp;A services rely heavily on tagging, which enables indexing and user search. Without appropriate tagging, these sites are far less effective. Often, however, tagging is left to the users' discretion. And since users don't have lists of commonly searched terms or a deep understanding of the categorization or information architecture of a site, posts are frequently mislabeled. This makes it difficult or impossible to find that content when it's needed later.</p>\n<p>By combining deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) with data on site-specific search terms, this solution helps greatly improve tagging accuracy on your site. As your user types their post, it offers highly used terms as suggested tags, making it easier for others to find the information they're providing.</p>",

The company wants to modernize their data architecture to better monitor operating conditions and equipment health. Replacing the company's legacy solution using on-premises infrastructure would be both time intensive and labor intensive, and would not be able to scale sufficiently to handle the anticipated data volume.</p>\n<p>The company wants to build a cloud-based \"smart construction\" solution. It should gather a comprehensive set of data for a construction site and automate the operation and maintenance of the various elements of the site. The company's goals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrating and analyzing all construction site equipment and data to minimize equipment downtime and reduce theft.</li>\n<li>Remotely and automatically controlling construction equipment to mitigate the effects of a labor shortage, ultimately requiring fewer workers and enabling lower-skilled workers to succeed.</li>\n<li>Minimizing the operating costs and labor requirements for the supporting infrastructure, while increasing productivity and safety.</li>\n<li>Easily scaling the infrastructure to support increases in telemetry data.</li>\n<li>Complying with all relevant legal requirements by provisioning resources in-country without compromising system availability.</li>\n<li>Using open-source software to maximize the investment in workers' current skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using managed Azure services such as IoT Hub and HDInsight will allow the customer to rapidly build and deploy a comprehensive solution with a lower operating cost.

IoT solutions use events, insights, and actions to connect devices, or things, to cloud applications and achieve end-to-end scenarios. The terms <em>thing</em> and <em>device</em> both mean a connected physical device in an IoT solution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A diagram showing devices generating events, which inform insights and actions.\" src=\"media/devices-events-insights.png\" />\u00a0</p>\n<p>Events, insights, and actions are functional concepts that exist across the <a >devices, platform, and applications</a> of an IoT solution. To illustrate, consider an application that monitors cooling system temperatures for food storage, and calls emergency maintenance services if a temperature becomes dangerously low or high:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A diagram illustrating the relationship between events, insights, and actions in an IoT solution used to monitor a food storage system.\" src=\"media/events-insights-actions.png\" /></p>\n<p>The cooling system sends operating temperatures as telemetry to a connected application through <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub\">Azure IoT Hub</a>. Backup systems exist in case a primary cooling system malfunctions or goes offline. Devices can receive commands to adjust temperature or start and stop operation.</p>\n<p>The following process occurs in this example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Devices send events.</strong> Devices send temperature samples from the primary cooling system to the application's IoT Hub, via device-to-cloud events, every 30 seconds. </li>\n<li><strong>Events generate insights.</strong> Routing rules in the IoT Hub evaluate events for any immediate contextual insights, such as temperatures at malfunctioning levels.</li>\n<li><strong>Insights inform actions.</strong> If the temperature is at a malfunctioning level, event routing sends the event to a specific handler to take action. The handler invokes an action to another process to dispatch maintenance to the site, and sends a command to the backup system to start while maintenance is enroute to the location.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Considering events, insights, and actions allows expansion of the cooling system monitoring scenario. The system can add more complex insights and actions by using the events from the cooling system devices:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A diagram illustrating the events, insights, and actions associated with the cooling system monitoring scenario.\" src=\"media/events-downstream.png\" /></p>\n<p>While the series of events doesn't change, gathering events and applying different types of insights to the events enables taking additional actions with the data. This strategy becomes more powerful when applied to large numbers of devices operating at multiple locations.</p>",

            "Summary": "<p>This article describes how the Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team partnered with a global retailer to deploy a highly-available serverless solution across both Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platforms, using the <a href=\"https://serverless.com\">Serverless Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>In <em>serverless computing</em>, the cloud provider dynamically allocates microservices resources to run code, and only charges for the resources used. Serverless computing abstracts app code from infrastructure implementation, code deployment, and operational aspects like planning and maintenance.</p>\n<p>As with other services, each cloud provider has its own serverless implementation, and it's difficult for customers to use a different provider without considerable operational impact and costs. Potential customers may view this situation as weakening their bargaining position and agility. Vendor lock-in is one of the greatest obstacles to enterprise cloud adoption.</p>\n<p>The open-source <em>Serverless Framework</em> is a universal cloud interface for developing and deploying serverless computing solutions across cloud providers. Open-sourcing and common APIs for serverless functions help providers, customers, and partners build cross-cloud solutions for best-of-breed services. The Serverless Framework reduces barriers to cloud adoption by addressing the problems of vendor lock-in and cross-cloud provider redundancy. Customers can optimize their solutions based on cost, agility, and other considerations.</p>\n<p>CSE and the Azure product team collectively rewrote the <em>Serverless CLI</em> to support new Azure Functions features like Premium Functions, API Management, and KeyVault. The Serverless CLI now provides a standard interface for GitOps deployment to both Azure and AWS. The team also developed the <em>Serverless Multicloud Library</em>, which provides a <em>normalized runtime API</em> to deploy serverless apps to both AWS and Azure.</p>\n<p>This design provides high availability with <em>active-active</em> failover between multiple cloud platforms, as opposed to <em>active-passive</em> failover. If the service of one cloud provider becomes unhealthy or unavailable, this solution can reroute requests to another cloud platform.</p>\n<p>This project met the following technical goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a cross-industry solution.</li>\n<li>Use the Multicloud Serverless Library to support a cloud-agnostic API that interfaces with microservices wherever they are deployed.</li>\n<li>Support a GitOps CI/CD process workflow for development, testing, and deployment on all supported cloud platforms.</li>\n<li>Use API-based access via an authenticated cloud gateway, and load balance between cloud platforms by using the gateway as a router.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other potential benefits of using the Serverless Framework include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevention or reduction of vendor lock-in</li>\n<li>40-60+% code reduction during development by using the Multicloud Serverless Library</li>\n<li>Development of best-of-breed solutions that combine different cloud providers' services</li>\n<li>Elimination of most platform and infrastructure complexity and maintenance requirements</li>\n<li>Easier data sharing, performance and cost comparisons, and ability to take advantage of special offerings</li>\n<li>Active-active high availability</li>\n</ul>",

It is assumed that Oracle Data Guard (or Active Data Guard) is used for HA/DR purposes. Depending on the application, either the application can be migrated first or the database. In this case, the application is migrated to Azure using Azure Load Balancer. This enables you to split your traffic between on-premises and Azure, allowing you to gradually migrate your application tier. The database migration is performed in multiple steps. As a first step, Oracle Data Guard is used to set up a Secondary/Standby Database in Azure. This allows you to migrate your data to Azure. Once the secondary in Azure is in-sync with the primary, you can flip the database in Azure to be your primary database while maintaining your secondary on-premises. As a next step, you may set up a secondary database in a different Availability Zone (or region) for HA/DR purposes. At this point, you can decommission your on-premises environment. All data traffic between on-premises and Azure flows over Azure ExpressRoute or Site-to-Site VPN connectivity.</p>",

            "Summary": "<p>The <em>Internet-of-things (IoT) Edge</em> brings data processing and storage close to the data source, enabling fast, consistent responses with reduced dependency on cloud connectivity and resources. Edge computing can incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models to create <em>intelligent edge</em> devices and networks, which can integrate with the cloud for further processing and security.</p>\n<p>This article describes a collaboration between the Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team and a major railway company to create an <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/future-of-cloud/\">intelligent cloud and intelligent edge</a> train maintenance and safety solution. The railway company wants to improve railroad safety and efficiency by proactively identifying defective components, predictively scheduling maintenance and repair, and continuously improving their findings and predictions. The pilot project for the <em>ML on Edge</em> solution is a train wheel health analysis system.</p>\n<p>Over 4,000 trackside detectors continuously monitor and stream wheel data from all the company's trains. The detectors measure heat and force of equipment on the tracks, listen for invisible wheel bearing defects or wheel cracks, and identify missing or misplaced parts. The ML on Edge system processes and acts on this continuous streaming detector data in near-real time to identify at-risk equipment, determine repair urgency, generate alerts, and send data to the Azure cloud for storage. The IoT Edge modules run on server class hardware in trackside bungalows, allowing for future parallel deployment of other workloads.</p>\n<p>Bringing ML and business logic closer to the data sources lets devices react faster to local changes and critical events. Devices can operate reliably offline or when connectivity is limited. The Edge network can determine which data to send to the cloud, or prioritize urgent and important data first.</p>\n<p>The wheel health analysis system provides early identification of potential equipment failure, helping prevent catastrophic failures that could lead to train derailment. The company can use stored data to spot trends and inform prescriptive maintenance and overhaul schedules.</p>",

This example sets up reservoir simulation software on an Azure high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Azure makes it possible to run this type of workload with maximum performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.</p>\n<p>The architecture in this example supports OPM Flow, a popular open-source oil and gas reservoir simulation package from the Open Porous Media (OPM) initiative.

The HPC resources run OPM Flow and send calculated results to a file share. In this example, the file share is a 4-terabyte (TB) network file system (NFS) space on the head node VM. Depending on your model and your input and output (I/O) requirements, you can use other <a href=\"#storage\">storage</a> options.</p>\n<p>A Windows Azure VM running OPM ResInsight, an open-source visualization tool, accesses the file share to <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azurecat/remote-visualization-in-azure/ba-p/745184\">model and visualize</a> the calculated results.

            "Summary": "<p>Recommendations are a main revenue driver for many businesses and are used in different kinds of industries, including retail, news, and media. With the availability of large amounts of data, you can now provide highly relevant recommendations using machine learning.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of recommendation systems: collaborative filtering and content-based. Collaborative filtering identifies similar patterns in customer behavior and recommends items that other similar customers have interacted with. Content-based recommendation uses information about the items to learn customer preferences and recommends items that share properties with items that a customer has previously interacted with. The approach described in this document focuses on the content-based recommendation system.</p>\n<p>This example scenario shows how your business can use machine learning to automate content-based personalization for your customers. At a high level, we use <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/databricks\">Azure Databricks</a> to train a model that predicts the probability a user will engage with an item. That model is deployed to production as a prediction service using <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service\">Azure Kubernetes Service</a>. In turn, you can use this prediction to create personalized recommendations by ranking items based on the content that a user is most likely to consume.</p>",

Back-end cloud services, such as databases and storage, provide APIs that enable client applications to connect directly to these services.</li>\n<li><strong>Functions as a service</strong> (FaaS). In this model, a \"function\" is a piece of code that is deployed to the cloud and runs inside a hosting environment that completely abstracts the servers that run the code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both definitions have in common the idea that developers and DevOps personnel don't need to deploy, configure, or manage servers. This reference architecture focuses on FaaS using Azure Functions, although serving web content from Azure Blob Storage could be an example of BaaS. Some important characteristics of FaaS are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compute resources are allocated dynamically as needed by the platform.</li>\n<li>Consumption-based pricing: You are charged only for the compute resources used to execute your code.</li>\n<li>The compute resources scale on demand based on traffic, without the developer needing to do any configuration.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Functions are executed when an external trigger occurs, such as an HTTP request or a message arriving on a queue. This makes an <a >event-driven architecture style</a> natural for serverless architectures. To coordinate work between components in the architecture, consider using message brokers or pub/sub patterns. For help with choosing between messaging technologies in Azure, see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services\">Choose between Azure services that deliver messages</a>.</p>",

CTI can range from written reports on a threat actor's motivations, infrastructure, and techniques, to specific observations of IP addresses, domains, and file hashes. CTI provides essential context for unusual activity, so security personnel can act quickly to protect people and assets.</p>\n<p>The most utilized CTI in SIEM solutions like Azure Sentinel is threat indicator data, sometimes called <em>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)</em>. Threat indicators associate URLs, file hashes, IP addresses, and other data with known threat activity like phishing, botnets, or malware. This form of threat intelligence is often called <em>tactical threat intelligence</em>, because security products and automation can use it in large scale to protect and detect potential threats. Azure Sentinel can help detect, respond to, and provide CTI context for malicious cyber activity. </p>",

For example, research increasingly confirms the importance of high-quality light and natural light cycles for promoting human alertness, health, well-being, and productivity. BrainLit's patented BioCentric Lighting\u2122 (BCL) system is a dynamic, self-learning, IoT-based system that creates high-quality natural lighting for indoor environments. </p>\n<p>The BCL system can also deliver radiant energy in the non-visible ultraviolet (UV) spectrum to kill viruses. All UV radiation has antimicrobial capabilities. The shortest wavelength, 200-300 nm UVC radiation, causes DNA inactivation and prevents viral replication. UVC radiation disinfection is an important weapon in the fight against COVID. BrainLit's new UVEN concept combines BCL light control with UVC disinfection to promote health and well-being and help kill viruses.</p>\n<p>Other UVC virus-killing technology that uses plug-in devices, robots, drones, and wands can't provide overall space coverage or performance and effectiveness data. To operate these devices safely and efficiently disrupts business and personnel, resulting in loss of productivity and lower space utilization. UVEN disinfection operates in unoccupied spaces during non-use times, providing safe, comprehensive, autonomous microbe deactivation without business disruption.</p>\n<p>Because IoT devices work directly on the physical environment and may use and collect sensitive data, device safety and security are paramount. UVEN double fail-safe features ensure occupants receive beneficial light only.

            "Summary": "<p><em>Logging</em> uses discrete event messages to track and report application data in a centralized way. Log events provide an overview of application execution state, track code errors or application failures, and deliver informational messages. Automation can read event logs and notify relevant parties if events meet a criterion or threshold.</p>\n<p><em>Tracing</em> focuses on the continuous flow of an application. Tracing follows program execution through various methods and services from beginning to end, while understanding data state and transitions.</p>\n<p><em>Monitoring</em> applies application instrumentation to both tracing or logging data to provide metrics that teams can use to make informed decisions. These metrics can aggregate log or trace data in a dashboard that gives a holistic view of application health, from utilization to error count.</p>\n<p>Whenever an application fails, teams need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did the application fail?</li>\n<li>When did the application exception occur?</li>\n<li>Which method caused the exception?</li>\n<li>What were the events recorded up to the point of application failure?</li>\n<li>Did this exception lead to potential data corruption?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logging, tracing, and monitoring can provide the answers to these questions, as well as monitor application usage and performance.</p>\n<p>For traditional on-premises or monolithic applications, logging, tracing, and monitoring happen within a single process domain. The application consists of a single executable and its dependencies. The executable runs under the single process space on a single virtual machine (VM), or across multiple VMs to increase performance.</p>\n<p>Cloud-native development differs from on-premises methodology. Many cloud-native applications consist of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services built around the <a >microservices</a> architectural paradigm. Microservices architectures involve discrete, loosely coupled services that work within their own process boundaries. Microservices architectures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consist of discrete services that are easier to build and simpler to maintain.</li>\n<li>Focus on business capabilities.</li>\n<li>Work well with automated continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) systems.</li>\n<li>Are more fault-tolerant, because a single service failure doesn't bring down the application.</li>\n<li>Allow services to scale independently of each other to provide better utilization and cost optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logging and tracing for cloud-native distributed applications can be complicated. A single application request can interact with many microservices. Each microservice generates its own logging, and determining the application execution process flow can be difficult. Because microservices can handle hundreds of requests concurrently, wading through logs to manually determine event correlations can be a laborious task.</p>\n<p>Several Azure services and strategies can help automate and manage effective logging, tracing, and monitoring for microservices applications. With unified logging, development and operations teams can gain deep insights from within as well as from outside application domains. Unified logging and monitoring help ensure that deployed cloud-native applications remain reliable, scalable, redundant, resilient, and secure.</p>",
