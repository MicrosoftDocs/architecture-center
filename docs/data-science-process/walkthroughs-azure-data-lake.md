# Azure Data Lake data science walkthroughs using U-SQL

These walkthroughs use U-SQL with Azure Data Lake to do predictive analytics. They follow the steps outlined in the Team Data Science Process. For an overview of the Team Data Science Process, see [Data Science Process](overview.md). For an introduction to Azure Data Lake, see [Overview of Azure Data Lake Store](/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview).

Additional data science walkthroughs that execute the Team Data Science Process are grouped by the **platform** that they use. See [Walkthroughs executing the Team Data Science Process](walkthroughs.md) for an itemization of these examples.

## Predict taxi tips using U-SQL with Azure Data Lake

The [Use Azure Data Lake for data science](data-lake-walkthrough.md) walkthrough shows how to use Azure Data Lake to do data exploration and binary classification tasks.  The data are a sample of the NYC taxi dataset.  The task is predicting whether or not a tip is paid by a customer.
