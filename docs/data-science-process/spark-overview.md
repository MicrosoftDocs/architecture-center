# Data science using Spark on Azure HDInsight

This suite of topics shows how to use HDInsight Spark to complete common data science tasks such as data ingestion, feature engineering, modeling, and model evaluation. The data used is a sample of the 2013 NYC taxi trip and fare dataset. The models built include logistic and linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosted trees. The topics also show how to store these models in Azure blob storage (WASB) and how to score and evaluate their predictive performance. More advanced topics cover how models can be trained using cross-validation and hyper-parameter sweeping. This overview topic also references the topics that describe how to set up the Spark cluster that you need to complete the steps in the walkthroughs provided.

## Spark and MLlib
[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an open-source parallel processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analytic applications. The Spark processing engine is built for speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. Spark's in-memory distributed computation capabilities make it a good choice for the iterative algorithms used in machine learning and graph computations. [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) is Spark's scalable machine learning library that brings the algorithmic modeling capabilities to this distributed environment.

## HDInsight Spark
[HDInsight Spark](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview) is the Azure hosted offering of open-source Spark. It also includes support for **Jupyter PySpark notebooks** on the Spark cluster that can run Spark SQL interactive queries for transforming, filtering, and visualizing data stored in Azure Blobs (WASB). PySpark is the Python API for Spark. The code snippets that provide the solutions and show the relevant plots to visualize the data here run in Jupyter notebooks installed on the Spark clusters. The modeling steps in these topics contain code that shows how to train, evaluate, save, and consume each type of model.

## Setup: Spark clusters and Jupyter notebooks
Setup steps and code are provided in this walkthrough for using an HDInsight Spark 1.6. But Jupyter notebooks are provided for both HDInsight Spark 1.6 and Spark 2.0 clusters. A description of the notebooks and links to them are provided in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Readme.md) for the GitHub repository containing them. Moreover, the code here and in the linked notebooks is generic and should work on any Spark cluster. If you are not using HDInsight Spark, the cluster setup and management steps may be slightly different from what is shown here. For convenience, here are the links to the Jupyter notebooks for Spark 1.6 (to be run in the pySpark kernel of the Jupyter Notebook server) and Spark 2.0 (to be run in the pySpark3 kernel of the Jupyter Notebook server):

### Spark 1.6 notebooks
These notebooks are to be run in the pySpark kernel of Jupyter notebook server.

- [pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark1.6/pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb): Provides information on how to perform data exploration, modeling, and scoring with several different algorithms.
- [pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark1.6/pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb): Includes topics in notebook #1, and model development using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- [pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-model-consumption.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark1.6/pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-model-consumption.ipynb): Shows how to operationalize a saved model using Python on HDInsight clusters.

### Spark 2.0 notebooks
These notebooks are to be run in the pySpark3 kernel of Jupyter notebook server.

- [Spark2.0-pySpark3-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark2.0/Spark2.0-pySpark3-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb): This file provides information on how to perform data exploration, modeling, and scoring in Spark 2.0 clusters using the NYC Taxi trip and fare data-set described [here](#the-nyc-2013-taxi-data). This notebook may be a good starting point for quickly exploring the code we have provided for Spark 2.0. For a more detailed notebook analyzes the NYC Taxi data, see the next notebook in this list. See the notes following this list that compares these notebooks.
- [Spark2.0-pySpark3_NYC_Taxi_Tip_Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark2.0/Spark2.0_pySpark3_NYC_Taxi_Tip_Regression.ipynb): This file shows how to perform data wrangling (Spark SQL and dataframe operations), exploration, modeling and scoring using the NYC Taxi trip and fare data-set described [here](#the-nyc-2013-taxi-data).
- [Spark2.0-pySpark3_Airline_Departure_Delay_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark2.0/Spark2.0_pySpark3_Airline_Departure_Delay_Classification.ipynb): This file shows how to perform data wrangling (Spark SQL and dataframe operations), exploration, modeling and scoring using the well-known Airline On-time departure dataset from 2011 and 2012. We integrated the airline dataset with the airport weather data (for example, windspeed, temperature, altitude etc.) prior to modeling, so these weather features can be included in the model.

<!-- -->

> [!NOTE]
> The airline dataset was added to the Spark 2.0 notebooks to better illustrate the use of classification algorithms. See the following links for information about airline on-time departure dataset and weather dataset:

>
> - Airport weather data: [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

> [!NOTE]
> The Spark 2.0 notebooks on the NYC taxi and airline flight delay data-sets can take 10 mins or more to run (depending on the size of your HDI cluster). The first notebook in the above list shows many aspects of the data exploration, visualization and ML model training in a notebook that takes less time to run with down-sampled NYC data set, in which the taxi and fare files have been pre-joined: [Spark2.0-pySpark3-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark2.0/Spark2.0-pySpark3-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb). This notebook takes a much shorter time to finish (2-3 mins) and may be a good starting point for quickly exploring the code we have provided for Spark 2.0.

<!-- -->

For guidance on the operationalization of a Spark 2.0 model and model consumption for scoring, see the [Spark 1.6 document on consumption](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/pySpark/Spark1.6/pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-model-consumption.ipynb) for an example outlining the steps required. To use this example on Spark 2.0, replace the Python code file with [this file](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/Spark/Python/Spark2.0_ConsumeRFCV_NYCReg.py).

### Prerequisites
