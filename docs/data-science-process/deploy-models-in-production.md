# Deploy ML models to production to play an active role in making business decisions

Production deployment enables a model to play an active role in a business. Predictions from a deployed model can be used for business decisions.

## Production platforms

There are various approaches and platforms to put models into production. Here are a few options:

- [Where to deploy models with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-and-where)
- [Deployment of a model in SQL-server](/sql/advanced-analytics/tutorials/sqldev-py6-operationalize-the-model)

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to deployment, one has to insure the latency of model scoring is low enough to use in production.

> [!NOTE]
> For deployment from Azure Machine Learning, see [Deploy machine learning models to Azure](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-and-where).

## A/B testing

When multiple models are in production, [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) may be used to compare model performance.
