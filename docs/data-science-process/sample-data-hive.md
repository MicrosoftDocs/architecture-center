# Sample data in Azure HDInsight Hive tables
This article describes how to down-sample data stored in Azure HDInsight Hive tables using Hive queries to reduce it to a size more manageable for analysis. It covers three popularly used sampling methods:

* Uniform random sampling
* Random sampling by groups
* Stratified sampling

**Why sample your data?** If the dataset you plan to analyze is large, it's usually a good idea to down-sample the data to reduce it to a smaller but representative and more manageable size. Down-sampling facilitates data understanding, exploration, and feature engineering. Its role in the Team Data Science Process is to enable fast prototyping of the data processing functions and machine learning models.

This sampling task is a step in the [Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/).

## How to submit Hive queries
Hive queries can be submitted from the Hadoop Command-Line console on the head node of the Hadoop cluster.  Log into the head node of the Hadoop cluster, open the Hadoop Command-Line console, and submit the Hive queries from there. For instructions on submitting Hive queries in the Hadoop Command-Line console, see [How to Submit Hive Queries](move-hive-tables.md#submit).

## <a name="uniform"></a> Uniform random sampling
Uniform random sampling means that each row in the data set has an equal chance of being sampled. It can be implemented by adding an extra field rand() to the data set in the inner "select" query, and in the outer "select" query that condition on that random field.

Here is an example query:

```python
SET sampleRate=<sample rate, 0-1>;
select
    field1, field2, …, fieldN
from
    (
    select
        field1, field2, …, fieldN, rand() as samplekey
    from <hive table name>
    )a
where samplekey<='${hiveconf:sampleRate}'
```

Here, `<sample rate, 0-1>` specifies the proportion of records that the users want to sample.

## <a name="group"></a> Random sampling by groups
When sampling categorical data, you may want to either include or exclude all of the instances for some value of the categorical variable. This sort of sampling is called "sampling by group". For example, if you have a categorical variable "*State*", which has values such as NY, MA, CA, NJ, and PA, you want records from each state to be together, whether they are sampled or not.

Here is an example query that samples by group:

```python
SET sampleRate=<sample rate, 0-1>;
select
    b.field1, b.field2, …, b.catfield, …, b.fieldN
from
    (
    select
        field1, field2, …, catfield, …, fieldN
    from <table name>
    )b
join
    (
    select
        catfield
    from
        (
        select
            catfield, rand() as samplekey
        from <table name>
        group by catfield
        )a
    where samplekey<='${hiveconf:sampleRate}'
    )c
on b.catfield=c.catfield
```

## <a name="stratified"></a>Stratified sampling
Random sampling is stratified with respect to a categorical variable when the samples obtained have categorical values that are present in the same ratio as they were in the parent population. Using the same example as above, suppose your data has the following observations by states: NJ has 100 observations, NY has 60 observations, and WA has 300 observations. If you specify the rate of stratified sampling to be 0.5, then the sample obtained should have approximately 50, 30, and 150 observations of NJ, NY, and WA respectively.

Here is an example query:

```hiveql
SET sampleRate=<sample rate, 0-1>;
select
    field1, field2, field3, ..., fieldN, state
from
    (
    select
        field1, field2, field3, ..., fieldN, state,
        count(*) over (partition by state) as state_cnt,
          rank() over (partition by state order by rand()) as state_rank
      from <table name>
    ) a
where state_rank <= state_cnt*'${hiveconf:sampleRate}'
```
