# Walk-throughs executing the Team Data Science Process

These **comprehensive walk-throughs** demonstrate the steps in the Team Data Science Process for specific scenarios. They illustrate how to combine cloud, on-premises tools, and services into a workflow for an **intelligent application**. The walk-throughs are grouped by **platform** that they use.

## Walkthrough descriptions

Here are brief descriptions of what these walkthrough examples provide on their respective platforms:

- [HDInsight Spark walk-throughs using PySpark and Scala](walkthroughs-spark.md) These walk-throughs use PySpark and Scala on an Azure Spark cluster to do predictive analytics.
- [HDInsight Hadoop walk-throughs using Hive](walkthroughs-hdinsight-hadoop.md) These walk-throughs use Hive with an HDInsight Hadoop cluster to do predictive analytics.
- [Azure Data Lake walk-throughs using U-SQL](walkthroughs-azure-data-lake.md) These walk-throughs use U-SQL with Azure Data Lake to do predictive analytics.
- [SQL Server](walkthroughs-sql-server.md) These walk-throughs use SQL Server, SQL Server R Services, and SQL Server Python Services to do predictive analytics.
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](walkthroughs-sql-data-warehouse.md) These walk-throughs use Azure Synapse Analytics to do predictive analytics.

## Next steps
