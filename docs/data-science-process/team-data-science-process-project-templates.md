# Team Data Science Process project planning

The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) provides a lifecycle to structure the development of your data science projects. This article provides links to Microsoft Project and Excel templates that help you plan and manage these project stages.

The lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:

- Business Understanding
- Data Acquisition and Understanding
- Modeling
- Deployment
- Customer Acceptance

For descriptions of each of these stages, see [The Team Data Science Process lifecycle](./lifecycle.md).

## Next steps

[Agile development of data science projects](agile-development.md) This document describes a data science project in a systematic, version controlled, and collaborative way by using the Team Data Science Process.
