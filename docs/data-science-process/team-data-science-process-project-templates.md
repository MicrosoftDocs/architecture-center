# Team Data Science Process project planning

The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) provides a lifecycle to structure the development of your data science projects. 

The lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:

- Business Understanding
- Data Acquisition and Understanding
- Modeling
- Deployment
- Customer Acceptance

For descriptions of each of these stages, see [The Team Data Science Process lifecycle](./lifecycle.md).
