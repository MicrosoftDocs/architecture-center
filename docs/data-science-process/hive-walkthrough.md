# The Team Data Science Process in action: Use Azure HDInsight Hadoop clusters
In this walkthrough, we use the [Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](overview.md) in an end-to-end scenario. We use an [Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore, and feature-engineer data from the publicly available [NYC Taxi Trips](https://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset, and to down-sample the data. To handle binary and multiclass classification and regression predictive tasks, we build models of the data with Azure Machine Learning. 

For a walkthrough that shows how to handle a larger dataset, see [Team Data Science Process - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters on a 1-TB dataset](hive-criteo-walkthrough.md).

You can also use an IPython notebook to accomplish the tasks presented in the walkthrough that uses the 1-TB dataset. For more information, see [Criteo walkthrough using a Hive ODBC connection](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Misc/DataScienceProcess/iPythonNotebooks/machine-Learning-data-science-process-hive-walkthrough-criteo.ipynb).

## <a name="dataset"></a>NYC Taxi Trips dataset description
The NYC Taxi Trip data is about 20 GB of compressed comma-separated values (CSV) files (~48 GB uncompressed). It has more than 173 million individual trips, and includes the fares paid for each trip. Each trip record includes the pick-up and dropoff location and time, anonymized hack (driver's) license number, and medallion number (the taxi's unique ID). The data covers all trips in the year 2013, and is provided in the following two datasets for each month:

- The trip_data CSV files contain trip details: the number of passengers, pick up and dropoff points, trip duration, and trip length. Here are a few sample records:

  `medallion,hack_license,vendor_id,rate_code,store_and_fwd_flag,pickup_datetime,dropoff_datetime,passenger_count,trip_time_in_secs,trip_distance,pickup_longitude,pickup_latitude,dropoff_longitude,dropoff_latitude`

- The trip_fare CSV files contain details of the fare paid for each trip: payment type, fare amount, surcharge and taxes, tips and tolls, and the total amount paid. Here are a few sample records:

  `medallion, hack_license, vendor_id, pickup_datetime, payment_type, fare_amount, surcharge, mta_tax, tip_amount, tolls_amount, total_amount`

  `89D227B655E5C82AECF13C3F540D4CF4,BA96DE419E711691B9445D6A6307C170,CMT,2013-01-01 15:11:48,CSH,6.5,0,0.5,0,0,7`

The unique key to join trip\_data and trip\_fare is composed of the fields: medallion, hack\_license, and pickup\_datetime. To get all of the details relevant to a particular trip, it is sufficient to join with these three keys.

## <a name="mltasks"></a>Examples of prediction tasks
Determine the kind of predictions you want to make based on data analysis to help clarify the required process tasks. Here are three examples of prediction problems that we address in this walkthrough, all based on the *tip\_amount*:

- **Binary classification**: Predict whether or not a tip was paid for a trip. That is, a *tip\_amount* that is greater than $0 is a positive example, while a *tip\_amount* of $0 is a negative example.

  - Class 0: tip_amount = $0
  - Class 1: tip_amount > $0

- **Multiclass classification**: Predict the range of tip amounts paid for the trip. We divide the *tip\_amount* into five classes:

  - Class 0: tip_amount = $0
  - Class 1: tip_amount > $0 and tip_amount <= $5
  - Class 2: tip_amount > $5 and tip_amount <= $10
  - Class 3: tip_amount > $10 and tip_amount <= $20
  - Class 4: tip_amount > $20

- **Regression task**: Predict the amount of the tip paid for a trip.  

## <a name="setup"></a>Set up an HDInsight Hadoop cluster for advanced analytics
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically an admin task.
> 
> 

You can set up an Azure environment for advanced analytics that employs an HDInsight cluster in three steps:

1. [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create): This storage account is used for storing data in Azure Blob storage. The data used in HDInsight clusters also resides here.
2. [Customize Azure HDInsight Hadoop clusters for the Advanced Analytics Process and Technology](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql). This step creates an HDInsight Hadoop cluster with 64-bit Anaconda Python 2.7 installed on all nodes. There are two important steps to remember while customizing your HDInsight cluster.
   
   * Remember to link the storage account created in step 1 with your HDInsight cluster when you are creating it. This storage account accesses data that is processed within the cluster.
   * After you create the cluster, enable Remote Access to the head node of the cluster. Browse to the **Configuration** tab, and select **Enable Remote**. This step specifies the user credentials used for remote login.
3. [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](/azure/machine-learning/classic/create-workspace): You use this workspace to build machine learning models. This task is addressed after completing an initial data exploration and down-sampling, by using the HDInsight cluster.

## <a name="getdata"></a>Get the data from a public source
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically an admin task.
> 
> 

To copy the [NYC Taxi Trips](https://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset to your machine from its public location, use any of the methods described in [Move data to and from Azure Blob storage](move-azure-blob.md).

Here, we describe how to use AzCopy to transfer the files containing data. To download and install AzCopy, follow the instructions at [Getting started with the AzCopy command-line utility](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10).

1. From a command prompt window, run the following AzCopy commands, replacing *\<path_to_data_folder>* with the desired destination:

    ```console
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:https://nyctaxitrips.blob.core.windows.net/data /Dest:<path_to_data_folder> /S
    ```

1. When the copy completes, you will see a total of 24 zipped files in the data folder chosen. Unzip the downloaded files to the same directory on your local machine. Make a note of the folder where the uncompressed files reside. This folder is referred to as the *\<path\_to\_unzipped_data\_files\>* in what follows.

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload the data to the default container of the HDInsight Hadoop cluster
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically an admin task.
> 
> 

In the following AzCopy commands, replace the following parameters with the actual values that you specified when creating the Hadoop cluster and unzipping the data files.

* ***\<path_to_data_folder>*** The directory (along with the path) on your machine that contains the unzipped data files.  
* ***\<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>*** The storage account associated with your HDInsight cluster.
* ***\<default container of Hadoop cluster>*** The default container used by your cluster. The name of the default container is usually the same name as the cluster itself. For example, if the cluster is called "abc123.azurehdinsight.net", the default container is abc123.
* ***\<storage account key>*** The key for the storage account used by your cluster.

From a command prompt or a Windows PowerShell window, run the following two AzCopy commands.

This command uploads the trip data to the ***nyctaxitripraw*** directory in the default container of the Hadoop cluster.

```console
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:<path_to_unzipped_data_files> /Dest:https://<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>.blob.core.windows.net/<default container of Hadoop cluster>/nyctaxitripraw /DestKey:<storage account key> /S /Pattern:trip_data_*.csv
```

This command uploads the fare data to the ***nyctaxifareraw*** directory in the default container of the Hadoop cluster.

```console
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:<path_to_unzipped_data_files> /Dest:https://<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>.blob.core.windows.net/<default container of Hadoop cluster>/nyctaxifareraw /DestKey:<storage account key> /S /Pattern:trip_fare_*.csv
```

The data should now be in Blob storage, and ready to be consumed within the HDInsight cluster.

## <a name="#download-hql-files"></a>Sign in to the head node of Hadoop cluster and prepare for exploratory data analysis
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically an admin task.
> 
> 

To access the head node of the cluster for exploratory data analysis and down-sampling of the data, follow the procedure outlined in [Access the head node of Hadoop Cluster](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql).

In this walkthrough, we primarily use queries written in [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), a SQL-like query language, to perform preliminary data explorations. The Hive queries are stored in '.hql' files. We then down-sample this data to be used within Machine Learning for building models.

To prepare the cluster for exploratory data analysis, download the '.hql' files containing the relevant Hive scripts from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/tree/master/Misc/DataScienceProcess/DataScienceScripts) to a local directory (C:\temp) on the head node. Open the command prompt from within the head node of the cluster, and run the following two commands:

```console
set script='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/master/Misc/DataScienceProcess/DataScienceScripts/Download_DataScience_Scripts.ps1'

@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(%script%))"
```

These two commands download all '.hql' files needed in this walkthrough to the local directory ***C:\temp&#92;*** in the head node.

## <a name="#hive-db-tables"></a>Create Hive database and tables partitioned by month
> [!NOTE]
> This task is typically for an admin.
> 
> 

You are now ready to create Hive tables for the NYC taxi dataset.
In the head node of the Hadoop cluster, open the Hadoop command line on the desktop of the head node. Enter the Hive directory by running the following command:

```console
cd %hive_home%\bin
```

> [!NOTE]
> Run all Hive commands in this walkthrough from the Hive bin/ directory prompt. This handles any path issues automatically. We use the terms "Hive directory prompt", "Hive bin/ directory prompt", and "Hadoop command line" interchangeably in this walkthrough.
> 
> 

From the Hive directory prompt, run the following command in the Hadoop command line of the head node that creates the Hive database and tables:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_create_db_and_tables.hql"
```

Here is the content of the **C:\temp\sample\_hive\_create\_db\_and\_tables.hql** file that creates the Hive database **nyctaxidb**, and the tables **trip** and **fare**.

```hiveql
create database if not exists nyctaxidb;

create external table if not exists nyctaxidb.trip
(
    medallion string,
    hack_license string,
    vendor_id string,
    rate_code string,
    store_and_fwd_flag string,
    pickup_datetime string,
    dropoff_datetime string,
    passenger_count int,
    trip_time_in_secs double,
    trip_distance double,
    pickup_longitude double,
    pickup_latitude double,
    dropoff_longitude double,
    dropoff_latitude double)  
PARTITIONED BY (month int)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' lines terminated by '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION 'wasb:///nyctaxidbdata/trip' TBLPROPERTIES('skip.header.line.count'='1');

create external table if not exists nyctaxidb.fare
(
    medallion string,
    hack_license string,
    vendor_id string,
    pickup_datetime string,
    payment_type string,
    fare_amount double,
    surcharge double,
    mta_tax double,
    tip_amount double,
    tolls_amount double,
    total_amount double)
PARTITIONED BY (month int)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' lines terminated by '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION 'wasb:///nyctaxidbdata/fare' TBLPROPERTIES('skip.header.line.count'='1');
```

This Hive script creates two tables:

* The **trip** table contains trip details of each ride (driver details, pick-up time, trip distance, and times).
* The **fare** table contains fare details (fare amount, tip amount, tolls, and surcharges).

If you need any additional assistance with these procedures, or you want to investigate alternative ones, see the section [Submit Hive queries directly from the Hadoop command line](move-hive-tables.md#submit).

## <a name="#load-data"></a>Load data to Hive tables by partitions
> [!NOTE]
> This task is typically for an admin.
> 
> 

The NYC taxi dataset has a natural partitioning by month, which we use to enable faster processing and query times. The following PowerShell commands (issued from the Hive directory by using the Hadoop command line) load data to the trip and fare Hive tables, partitioned by month.

```powershell
for /L %i IN (1,1,12) DO (hive -hiveconf MONTH=%i -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_load_data_by_partitions.hql")
```

The **sample\_hive\_load\_data\_by\_partitions.hql** file contains the following **LOAD** commands:

```hiveql
LOAD DATA INPATH 'wasb:///nyctaxitripraw/trip_data_${hiveconf:MONTH}.csv' INTO TABLE nyctaxidb.trip PARTITION (month=${hiveconf:MONTH});
LOAD DATA INPATH 'wasb:///nyctaxifareraw/trip_fare_${hiveconf:MONTH}.csv' INTO TABLE nyctaxidb.fare PARTITION (month=${hiveconf:MONTH});
```

A number of the Hive queries used here in the exploration process involve looking at only one or two partitions. But these queries can be run across the entire dataset.

### <a name="#show-db"></a>Show databases in the HDInsight Hadoop cluster
To show the databases created in HDInsight Hadoop cluster inside the Hadoop command-line window, run the following command in the Hadoop command line:

```console
hive -e "show databases;"
```

### <a name="#show-tables"></a>Show the Hive tables in the **nyctaxidb** database
To show the tables in the **nyctaxidb** database, run the following command in the Hadoop command line:

```console
hive -e "show tables in nyctaxidb;"
```

We can confirm that the tables are partitioned by running the following command:

```console
hive -e "show partitions nyctaxidb.trip;"
```

Here is the expected output:

```output
month=1
month=10
month=11
month=12
month=2
month=3
month=4
month=5
month=6
month=7
month=8
month=9
Time taken: 2.075 seconds, Fetched: 12 row(s)
```

Similarly, we can ensure that the fare table is partitioned by running the following command:

```console
hive -e "show partitions nyctaxidb.fare;"
```

Here is the expected output:

```output
month=1
month=10
month=11
month=12
month=2
month=3
month=4
month=5
month=6
month=7
month=8
month=9
Time taken: 1.887 seconds, Fetched: 12 row(s)
```

## <a name="#explore-hive"></a>Data exploration and feature engineering in Hive
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

You  can use Hive queries to accomplish data exploration and feature engineering tasks for the data loaded into the Hive tables. Here are examples of such tasks:

* View the top 10 records in both tables.
* Explore data distributions of a few fields in varying time windows.
* Investigate data quality of the longitude and latitude fields.
* Generate binary and multiclass classification labels based on the tip amount.
* Generate features by computing the direct trip distances.

### Exploration: View the top 10 records in table trip
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

To see what the data looks like, examine 10 records from each table. To inspect the records, run the following two queries separately from the Hive directory prompt in the Hadoop command-line console.

To get the top 10 records in the trip table from the first month:

```console
hive -e "select * from nyctaxidb.trip where month=1 limit 10;"
```

To get the top 10 records in the fare table from the first month:

```console
hive -e "select * from nyctaxidb.fare where month=1 limit 10;"
```

You can save the records to a file for convenient viewing with a small change to the preceding query:

```console
hive -e "select * from nyctaxidb.fare where month=1 limit 10;" > C:\temp\testoutput
```

### Exploration: View the number of records in each of the 12 partitions
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

Of interest is how the number of trips varies during the calendar year. Grouping by month shows the distribution of trips.

```console
hive -e "select month, count(*) from nyctaxidb.trip group by month;"
```

This command produces the following output:

```output
1       14776615
2       13990176
3       15749228
4       15100468
5       15285049
6       14385456
7       13823840
8       12597109
9       14107693
10      15004556
11      14388451
12      13971118
Time taken: 283.406 seconds, Fetched: 12 row(s)
```

Here, the first column is the month, and the second is the number of trips for that month.

We can also count the total number of records in our trip dataset by running the following command at the Hive directory prompt:

```console
hive -e "select count(*) from nyctaxidb.trip;"
```

This command yields:

```output
173179759
Time taken: 284.017 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
```

Using commands similar to those shown for the trip dataset, we can issue Hive queries from the Hive directory prompt for the fare dataset to validate the number of records.

```console
hive -e "select month, count(*) from nyctaxidb.fare group by month;"
```

This command produces this output:

```output
1       14776615
2       13990176
3       15749228
4       15100468
5       15285049
6       14385456
7       13823840
8       12597109
9       14107693
10      15004556
11      14388451
12      13971118
Time taken: 253.955 seconds, Fetched: 12 row(s)
```

The exact same number of trips per month is returned for both datasets, providing  the first validation that the data has been loaded correctly.

You can count the total number of records in the fare dataset by using the following command from the Hive directory prompt:

```console
hive -e "select count(*) from nyctaxidb.fare;"
```

This command yields:

```output
173179759
Time taken: 186.683 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
```

The total number of records in both tables is also the same, providing a second validation that the data has been loaded correctly.

### Exploration: Trip distribution by medallion
> [!NOTE]
> This analysis is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

This example identifies the medallions (taxi numbers) with greater than 100 trips within a given time period. The query benefits from the partitioned table access, because it is conditioned by the partition variable **month**. The query results are written to a local file, **queryoutput.tsv**, in `C:\temp` on the head node.

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_trip_count_by_medallion.hql" > C:\temp\queryoutput.tsv
```

Here is the content of the **sample\_hive\_trip\_count\_by\_medallion.hql** file for inspection.

```hiveql
SELECT medallion, COUNT(*) as med_count
FROM nyctaxidb.fare
WHERE month<=3
GROUP BY medallion
HAVING med_count > 100
ORDER BY med_count desc;
```

The medallion in the NYC taxi dataset identifies a unique cab. You can identify which cabs are comparatively busy by asking which ones made more than a certain number of trips in a particular time period. The following example identifies cabs that made more than a hundred trips in the first three months, and saves the query results to a local file, **C:\temp\queryoutput.tsv**.

Here is the content of the **sample\_hive\_trip\_count\_by\_medallion.hql** file for inspection.

```hiveql
SELECT medallion, COUNT(*) as med_count
FROM nyctaxidb.fare
WHERE month<=3
GROUP BY medallion
HAVING med_count > 100
ORDER BY med_count desc;
```

From the Hive directory prompt, run the following command:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_trip_count_by_medallion.hql" > C:\temp\queryoutput.tsv
```

### Exploration: Trip distribution by medallion and hack license
> [!NOTE]
> This task is typically for a data scientist.
> 
> 

When exploring a dataset, we frequently want to examine the distributions of groups of values. This section provides an example of how to do this analysis for cabs and drivers.

The **sample\_hive\_trip\_count\_by\_medallion\_license.hql** file groups the fare dataset on **medallion** and **hack_license**, and returns counts of each combination. Here are its contents:

```hiveql
SELECT medallion, hack_license, COUNT(*) as trip_count
FROM nyctaxidb.fare
WHERE month=1
GROUP BY medallion, hack_license
HAVING trip_count > 100
ORDER BY trip_count desc;
```

This query returns cab and driver combinations, ordered by descending number of trips.

From the Hive directory prompt, run:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_trip_count_by_medallion_license.hql" > C:\temp\queryoutput.tsv
```

The query results are written to a local file, **C:\temp\queryoutput.tsv**.

### Exploration: Assessing data quality by checking for invalid longitude or latitude records
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

A common objective of exploratory data analysis is to weed out invalid or bad records. The example in this section determines whether either the longitude or latitude fields contain a value far outside the NYC area. Since it is likely that such records have an erroneous longitude-latitude value, we want to eliminate them from any data that is to be used for modeling.

Here is the content of **sample\_hive\_quality\_assessment.hql** file for inspection.

```hiveql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nyctaxidb.trip
    WHERE month=1
    AND  (CAST(pickup_longitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND -30
    OR    CAST(pickup_latitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN 30 AND 90
    OR    CAST(dropoff_longitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND -30
    OR    CAST(dropoff_latitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN 30 AND 90);
```

From the Hive directory prompt, run:

```console
hive -S -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_quality_assessment.hql"
```

The *-S* argument included in this command suppresses the status screen printout of the Hive Map/Reduce jobs. This command is useful because it makes the screen print of the Hive query output more readable.

### Exploration: Binary class distributions of trip tips
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.

For the binary classification problem outlined in the [Examples of prediction tasks](hive-walkthrough.md#mltasks) section, it is useful to know whether a tip was given or not. This distribution of tips is binary:

* tip given (Class 1, tip\_amount > $0)  
* no tip (Class 0, tip\_amount = $0)

The following **sample\_hive\_tipped\_frequencies.hql** file shows the command to run:

```hiveql
SELECT tipped, COUNT(*) AS tip_freq
FROM
(
    SELECT if(tip_amount > 0, 1, 0) as tipped, tip_amount
    FROM nyctaxidb.fare
)tc
GROUP BY tipped;
```

From the Hive directory prompt, run:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_tipped_frequencies.hql"
```


### Exploration: Class distributions in the multiclass setting
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.

> 

For the multiclass classification problem outlined in the [Examples of prediction tasks](hive-walkthrough.md#mltasks) section, this dataset also lends itself to a natural classification to predict the amount of the tips given. We can use bins to define tip ranges in the query. To get the class distributions for the various tip ranges, use the **sample\_hive\_tip\_range\_frequencies.hql** file. Here are its contents.

```hiveql
SELECT tip_class, COUNT(*) AS tip_freq
FROM
(
    SELECT if(tip_amount=0, 0,
        if(tip_amount>0 and tip_amount<=5, 1,
        if(tip_amount>5 and tip_amount<=10, 2,
        if(tip_amount>10 and tip_amount<=20, 3, 4)))) as tip_class, tip_amount
    FROM nyctaxidb.fare
)tc
GROUP BY tip_class;
```

Run the following command from the Hadoop command-line console:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_tip_range_frequencies.hql"
```

### Exploration: Compute the direct distance between two longitude-latitude locations
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

You might want to know if there is a difference between the direct distance between two locations, and the actual trip distance of the taxi. A passenger might be less likely to tip if they figure out that the driver has intentionally taken them by a longer route.

To see the comparison between actual trip distance and the [Haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) between two longitude-latitude points (the "great circle" distance), you can use the trigonometric functions available within Hive:

```hiveql
set R=3959;
set pi=radians(180);

insert overwrite directory 'wasb:///queryoutputdir'

select pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, trip_distance, trip_time_in_secs,
${hiveconf:R}*2*2*atan((1-sqrt(1-pow(sin((dropoff_latitude-pickup_latitude)
 *${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)-cos(pickup_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)
 *cos(dropoff_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)*pow(sin((dropoff_longitude-pickup_longitude)*${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)))
 /sqrt(pow(sin((dropoff_latitude-pickup_latitude)*${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)
 +cos(pickup_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)*cos(dropoff_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)*
 pow(sin((dropoff_longitude-pickup_longitude)*${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2))) as direct_distance
from nyctaxidb.trip
where month=1
and pickup_longitude between -90 and -30
and pickup_latitude between 30 and 90
and dropoff_longitude between -90 and -30
and dropoff_latitude between 30 and 90;
```

In the preceding query, R is the radius of the Earth in miles, and pi is converted to radians. The longitude-latitude points are filtered to remove values that are far from the NYC area.

In this case, we write the results to a directory called **queryoutputdir**. The sequence of the following commands first creates this output directory, and then runs the Hive command.

From the Hive directory prompt, run:

```hiveql
hdfs dfs -mkdir wasb:///queryoutputdir

hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_trip_direct_distance.hql"
```

The query results are written to nine Azure blobs (**queryoutputdir/000000\_0** to  **queryoutputdir/000008\_0**), under the default container of the Hadoop cluster.

To see the size of the individual blobs, run the following command from the Hive directory prompt:

```hiveql
hdfs dfs -ls wasb:///queryoutputdir
```

To see the contents of a given file, say **000000\_0**, use Hadoop's `copyToLocal` command.

```hiveql
hdfs dfs -copyToLocal wasb:///queryoutputdir/000000_0 C:\temp\tempfile
```

> [!WARNING]
> `copyToLocal` can be very slow for large files, and is not recommended for use with them.  
> 
> 

A key advantage of having this data reside in an Azure blob is that we can explore the data within Machine Learning, by using the [Import Data][import-data] module.

## <a name="#downsample"></a>Down-sample data and build models in Machine Learning
> [!NOTE]
> This is typically a data scientist task.
> 
> 

After the exploratory data analysis phase, we are now ready to down-sample the data for building models in Machine Learning. In this section, we show how to use a Hive query to down-sample the data. Machine Learning then accesses it from the [Import Data][import-data] module.

### Down-sampling the data
There are two steps in this procedure. First we join the **nyctaxidb.trip** and **nyctaxidb.fare** tables on three keys that are present in all records: **medallion**, **hack\_license**, and **pickup\_datetime**. We then generate a binary classification label, **tipped**, and a multiclass classification label, **tip\_class**.

To be able to use the down-sampled data directly from the [Import Data][import-data] module in Machine Learning, you should store the results of the preceding query to an internal Hive table. In what follows, we create an internal Hive table and populate its contents with the joined and down-sampled data.

The query applies standard Hive functions directly to generate the following time parameters from the **pickup\_datetime** field:
- hour of day
- week of year
- weekday ('1' stands for Monday, and '7' stands for Sunday)

The query also generates the direct distance between the pick-up and dropoff locations. For a complete list of such functions, see [LanguageManual UDF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF).

The query then down-samples the data so that the query results can fit into Azure Machine Learning Studio. Only about 1 percent of the original dataset is imported into the studio.

Here are the contents of **sample\_hive\_prepare\_for\_aml\_full.hql** file that prepares data for model building in Machine Learning:

```hiveql
set R = 3959;
set pi=radians(180);

)f
on t.medallion=f.medallion and t.hack_license=f.hack_license and t.pickup_datetime=f.pickup_datetime
where t.sample_key<=0.01
```

To run this query from the Hive directory prompt:

```console
hive -f "C:\temp\sample_hive_prepare_for_aml_full.hql"
```

We now have an internal table, **nyctaxidb.nyctaxi_downsampled_dataset**, which can be accessed by using the [Import Data][import-data] module from Machine Learning. Furthermore, we can use this dataset for building Machine Learning models.  

### Use the Import Data module in Machine Learning to access the down-sampled data
To issue Hive queries in the [Import Data][import-data] module of Machine Learning, you need access to a Machine Learning workspace. You also need access to the credentials of the cluster and its associated storage account.

Here are some details about the [Import Data][import-data] module and the parameters to input:

**HCatalog server URI**: If the cluster name is **abc123**, then use: https:\//abc123.azurehdinsight.net.

**Hadoop user account name**: The user name chosen for the cluster (not the remote access user name).

**Hadoop user account password**: The password chosen for the cluster (not the remote access password).

**Location of output data**: Chosen to be Azure.

**Azure Storage account name**: Name of the default storage account associated with the cluster.

**Azure container name**: The default container name for the cluster, and is typically the same as the cluster name. For a cluster called **abc123**, the name is abc123.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any table we wish to query by using the [Import Data][import-data] module in Machine Learning must be an internal table.
> 
> 

Here is how to determine if a table **T** in a database **D.db** is an internal table. From the Hive directory prompt, run the following command:

```hiveql
hdfs dfs -ls wasb:///D.db/T
```

If the table is an internal table and it is populated, its contents must show here.

Another way to determine whether a table is an internal table is to use Azure Storage Explorer. Use it to navigate to the default container name of the cluster, and then filter by the table name. If the table and its contents show up, this confirms that it is an internal table.

Here is a screenshot of the Hive query and the [Import Data][import-data] module:

![Screenshot of Hive query for Import Data module](./media/hive-walkthrough/1eTYf52.png)

Because our down-sampled data resides in the default container, the resulting Hive query from Machine Learning is simple. It is just a **SELECT * FROM nyctaxidb.nyctaxi\_downsampled\_data**.

The dataset can now be used as the starting point for building Machine Learning models.

### <a name="mlmodel"></a>Build models in Machine Learning
You can now proceed to model building and model deployment in [Machine Learning](https://studio.azureml.net). The data is ready for us to use in addressing the prediction problems identified earlier:

- **Binary classification**: To predict whether or not a tip was paid for a trip.

  **Learner used:** Two-class logistic regression

  a. For this problem, the target (or class) label is **tipped**. The original down-sampled dataset has a few columns that are target leaks for this classification experiment. In particular, **tip\_class**, **tip\_amount**, and **total\_amount** reveal information about the target label that is not available at testing time. We remove these columns from consideration by using the [Select Columns in Dataset][select-columns] module.

  The following diagram shows our experiment to predict whether or not a tip was paid for a given trip:

  ![Diagram of experiment to predict if tip was paid](./media/hive-walkthrough/QGxRz5A.png)

  b. For this experiment, our target label distributions were roughly 1:1.

   The following chart shows the distribution of tip class labels for the binary classification problem:

  ![Chart of distribution of tip class labels](./media/hive-walkthrough/9mM4jlD.png)

    As a result, we obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987, as shown in the following figure:

  ![Chart of AUC value](./media/hive-walkthrough/8JDT0F8.png)

- **Multiclass classification**: To predict the range of tip amounts paid for the trip, by using the previously defined classes.

  **Learner used:** Multiclass logistic regression

  a. For this problem, our target (or class) label is **tip\_class**, which can take one of five values (0,1,2,3,4). As in the binary classification case, we have a few columns that are target leaks for this experiment. In particular, **tipped**, **tip\_amount**, and **total\_amount** reveal information about the target label that is not available at testing time. We remove these columns by using the [Select Columns in Dataset][select-columns] module.

  The following diagram shows the experiment to predict in which bin a tip is likely to fall. The bins are: Class 0: tip = $0, Class 1: tip > $0 and tip <= $5, Class 2: tip > $5 and tip <= $10, Class 3: tip > $10 and tip <= $20, and Class 4: tip > $20.

  ![Diagram of experiment to predict bin for tip](./media/hive-walkthrough/5ztv0n0.png)

  We now show what the actual test class distribution looks like. Class 0 and Class 1 are prevalent, and the other classes are rare.

  ![Chart of test class distribution](./media/hive-walkthrough/Vy1FUKa.png)

  b. For this experiment, we use a confusion matrix to look at the prediction accuracies as shown here:

  ![Confusion matrix](./media/hive-walkthrough/cxFmErM.png)

  While the class accuracies on the prevalent classes are good, the model does not do a good job of "learning" on the rarer classes.

- **Regression task**: To predict the amount of tip paid for a trip.

  **Learner used:** Boosted decision tree

  a. For this problem, the target (or class) label is **tip\_amount**. The target leaks in this case are: **tipped**, **tip\_class**, and **total\_amount**. All these variables reveal information about the tip amount that is typically unavailable at testing time. We remove these columns by using the [Select Columns in Dataset][select-columns] module.

  The following diagram shows the experiment to predict the amount of the given tip:

  ![Diagram of experiment to predict amount of tip](./media/hive-walkthrough/11TZWgV.png)

  b. For regression problems, we measure the accuracies of the prediction by looking at the squared error in the predictions, and the coefficient of determination:

  ![Screenshot of prediction statistics](./media/hive-walkthrough/Jat9mrz.png)

  Here, the coefficient of determination is 0.709, implying that about 71 percent of the variance is explained by the model coefficients.
