# Modeling stage of the Team Data Science Process lifecycle

This article outlines the goals, tasks, and deliverables associated with the modeling stage of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP). This process provides a recommended lifecycle that you can use to structure your data-science projects. The lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:

   1. **Business understanding**
   2. **Data acquisition and understanding**
   3. **Modeling**
   4. **Deployment**
   5. **Customer acceptance**

Here is a visual representation of the TDSP lifecycle:

## Goals
* Determine the optimal data features for the machine-learning model.
* Create an informative machine-learning model that predicts the target most accurately.
* Create a machine-learning model that's suitable for production.

## How to do it
There are three main tasks addressed in this stage:

  * **Feature engineering**: Create data features from the raw data to facilitate model training.
  * **Model training**: Find the model that answers the question most accurately by comparing their success metrics.
  * Determine if your model is **suitable for production.**

### Feature engineering
Feature engineering involves the inclusion, aggregation, and transformation of raw variables to create the features used in the analysis. If you want insight into what is driving a model, then you need to understand how the features relate to each other and how the machine-learning algorithms are to use those features.

This step requires a creative combination of domain expertise and the insights obtained from the data exploration step. Feature engineering is a balancing act of finding and including informative variables, but at the same time trying to avoid too many unrelated variables. Informative variables improve your result; unrelated variables introduce unnecessary noise into the model. You also need to generate these features for any new data obtained during scoring. As a result, the generation of these features can only depend on data that's available at the time of scoring.

### Model training
Depending on the type of question that you're trying to answer, there are many modeling algorithms available. For guidance on choosing a prebuilt algorithm with designer, see [Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet for Azure Machine Learning designer](/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-cheat-sheet); other algorithms are available through open-source packages in R or Python. Although this article focuses on Azure Machine Learning, the guidance it provides is useful for any machine-learning projects.

The process for model training includes the following steps:

   * **Split the input data** randomly for modeling into a training data set and a test data set.
   * **Build the models** by using the training data set.
   * **Evaluate** the training and the test data set. Use a series of competing machine-learning algorithms along with the various associated tuning parameters (known as a *parameter sweep*) that are geared toward answering the question of interest with the current data.
   * **Determine the "best" solution** to answer the question by comparing the success metrics between alternative methods.

See [Train models with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/concept-train-machine-learning-model) for options on training models in Azure Machine Learning.

> [!NOTE]
> **Avoid leakage**: You can cause data leakage if you include data from outside the training data set that allows a model or machine-learning algorithm to make unrealistically good predictions. Leakage is a common reason why data scientists get nervous when they get predictive results that seem too good to be true. These dependencies can be hard to detect. To avoid leakage often requires iterating between building an analysis data set, creating a model, and evaluating the accuracy of the results.

## Model Evaluation
After training, the data scientist focuses next on model evaluation.

   * **Checkpoint decision**: Evaluate whether the model performs sufficiently for production. Some key questions to ask are:
     * Does the model answer the question with sufficient confidence given the test data?
     * Should you try any alternative approaches? 
     * Should you collect additional data, do more feature engineering, or experiment with other algorithms?
   * **Interpreting the Model**: Use [the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-interpretability-aml) to perform the following tasks:
      * Explain the entire model behavior or individual predictions on your personal machine locally.
      * Enable interpretability techniques for engineered features.
      * Explain the behavior for the entire model and individual predictions in Azure.
      * Upload explanations to Azure Machine Learning Run History.
      * Use a visualization dashboard to interact with your model explanations, both in a Jupyter notebook and in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
      * Deploy a scoring explainer alongside your model to observe explanations during inferencing.
   * **Assessing Fairness**: The [Fairlearn open-source Python package with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-machine-learning-fairness-aml) performs the following tasks:
      * Assess the fairness of your model predictions. This process will help you learn more about fairness in machine learning.
      * Upload, list, and download fairness assessment insights to/from Azure Machine Learning studio.  
      * See the fairness assessment dashboard in Azure Machine Learning studio to interact with your model(s)' fairness insights.
