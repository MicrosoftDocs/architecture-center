# Explore data in the Team Data Science Process

Exploring data is a step in the [Team Data Science Process](overview.yml).

The following articles describe how to explore data in three different storage environments that are typically used in the Data Science Process:

* Explore [Azure blob container](explore-data-blob.md) data using the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.
* Explore [SQL Server](explore-data-sql-server.md) data by using SQL and by using a programming language like Python.
* Explore [Hive table](explore-data-hive-tables.md) data using Hive queries.

The [Azure Machine Learning Resources](https://www.aka.ms/AMLservice) provide documentation and videos on getting started with Azure Machine Learning.
