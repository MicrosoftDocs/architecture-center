## Prerequisites
This document assumes that you have an Azure subscription, a storage account, and the corresponding storage key for that account. Before uploading/downloading data, you must know your Azure Storage account name and account key.

* To set up an Azure subscription, see [Free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* For instructions on creating a storage account and for getting account and key information, see [About Azure Storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create). Make a note the access key for your storage account as you need this key to connect to the account with the Azure Storage Explorer tool.
* The Azure Storage Explorer tool can be downloaded from [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). Accept the defaults during install.
