# Team Data Science Process for data scientists

This article provides guidance to a set of objectives that are typically used to implement comprehensive data science solutions with Azure technologies. You are guided through:

- understanding an analytics workload
- using the Team Data Science Process
- using Azure Machine Learning
- the foundations of data transfer and storage
- providing data source documentation
- using tools for analytics processing

These training materials are related to the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) and Microsoft and open-source software and toolkits, which are helpful for envisioning, executing and delivering data science solutions.

| Create a Data Processing Flow from Business Requirements                                  | [Determining the Question, following the TDSP](https://buckwoody.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/the-keys-to-effective-data-science-projects-the-question/) | With the development environment installed and configured, and the understanding of the technologies and processes in place, it's time to put everything together using the TDSP to perform an analysis. We need to start by defining the question, selecting the data sources, and the rest of the steps in the Team Data Science Process. Keep in mind the DevOps process as we work through this process. In this article, you learn how to take the requirements from your organization and create a data flow map through your application to define your solution using the Team Data Science Process | Locate a resource on "[The 5 data science questions](/azure/machine-learning/classic/data-science-for-beginners-the-5-questions-data-science-answers)" and describe one question your organization might have in these areas. Which algorithms should you focus on for that question?                                                                                                                                            |
