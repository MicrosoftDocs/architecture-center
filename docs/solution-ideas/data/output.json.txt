In this case, the application is migrated to Azure using Azure Load Balancer. This enables you to split your traffic between on-premises and Azure, allowing you to gradually migrate your application tier. The database migration is performed in multiple steps. As a first step, Oracle Data Guard is used to set up a Secondary/Standby Database in Azure. This allows you to migrate your data to Azure. Once the secondary in Azure is in-sync with the primary, you can flip the database in Azure to be your primary database while maintaining your secondary on-premises. As a next step, you may set up a secondary database in a different Availability Zone (or region) for HA/DR purposes. At this point, you can decommission your on-premises environment.
