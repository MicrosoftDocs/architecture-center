# Dev-Test deployment for testing PaaS solutions

[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

This architecture represents how to configure your infrastructure for development and testing of a standard PaaS-style system.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops), [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache) and Application Insights. These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Components

* [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops) manage the development process.
* The [Microsoft Release Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/getting-started/configure-agents) build and release agents deploy the Azure Resource Manager template and associated code to the various environments.
* [Resource Groups](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/getting-started/configure-agents): AzureDevOps resource groups are used to define all the services required to deploy the solution into a dev-test or production environment.
* [Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web): A web app runs the website and is deployed to all environments. Staging slots are used to swap pre-production and production versions.
* [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database) maintains data for the website. Copies are deployed in the dev, test, and production environments.
* [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache) is used in each environment to improve performance of the website.
* Application Insights: Application Insights monitors the web application during development and test runs, and then monitors the full production system when it's released.
