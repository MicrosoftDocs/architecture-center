Build, deploy, and manage high-quality models with Azure Machine Learning, a service for the end-to-end ML lifecycle. Use industry-leading MLOps (machine learning operations), open-source interoperability, and integrated tools on a secure, trusted platform designed for responsible machine learning (ML).

## Potential use cases

* Use machine learning as a service.
* Easy and flexible building interface.
* Wide range of supported algorithms.
* Easy implementation of web services.
* Great documentation for machine learning solutions.

## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. Bring together all your structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data (logs, files, and media) into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
1. Use Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics to clean, transform, and analyze datasets.
1. Build and train machine learning models in Azure Machine Learning.  
1. Control access and authentication for data and the ML workspace with Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vault. Manage containers with Azure Container Registry.
1. Deploy the machine learning model to a container using Azure Kubernetes Services, securing and managing the deployment with Azure VNets and Azure Load Balancer.
1. Using log metrics and monitoring from Azure Monitor, evaluate model performance.
1. Retrain models as necessary in Azure Machine Learning.
1. Visualize data outputs with Power BI.

### Components

* [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) is an enterprise-grade machine learning (ML) service for the end-to-end ML lifecycle.
* [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics) is a unified service where you can ingest, explore, prepare, transform, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.
* [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage) is a massively scalable and secure data lake for your high-performance analytics workloads.
* [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry) is a registry of Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, with support for all OCI artifacts. Build, store, secure, scan, replicate, and manage container images and artifacts with a fully managed, geo-replicated instance of OCI distribution.
* [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service) Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. Deploy and manage containerized applications more easily with a fully managed Kubernetes service.
* [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) lets you collect, analyze, and act on telemetry data from your Azure and on-premises environments. Azure Monitor helps you maximize performance and availability of your applications and proactively identify problems in seconds.
* [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault) safeguards cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services.
* [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer) load-balances internet and private network traffic with high performance and low latency. Load Balancer works across virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and IP addresses.
* [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a suite of business analytics tools that deliver insights throughout your organization. Connect to hundreds of data sources, simplify data prep, and drive unplanned analysis. Produce beautiful reports, then publish them for your organization to consume on the web and across mobile devices.
