Start simple with the content management system that enables you to easily maintain the messaging on your website in real-time, from a browser, with no coding skills.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor), [Content Delivery Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn) and [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Components

* [Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web): An App Service Web App runs in a single region, accessible to web and mobile browsers. A content management system like Orchard or Umbraco provides service to manage and deploy content to the website.
* [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database): A SQL Database stores and serves data about the site.
* [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor): Application Insights, provides health and performance monitoring, and diagnostics.
* [Content Delivery Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn): A content delivery network serves static content such as images, script, and CSS, and reduces the load on the web app servers.
* [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache) enables very fast queries, and improves scalability by reducing the load on the main database.
