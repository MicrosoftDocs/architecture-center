Easily tier data and applications on-premises and in Azure with architecture that supports greater efficiency in applications. Filter unnecessary data early in the process, easily bring cloud applications close to the data on-premises, and analyze large scale aggregate data from multiple locations in Azure for fleet-level insights.

## Architecture

## Data Flow

1. Data flows into a storage account.
1. Function on Azure Stack analyzes the data for anomalies or compliance.
1. Locally-relevant insights are displayed on the Azure Stack app.
1. Insights and anomalies are placed into a queue.
1. The bulk of the data is placed into an archive storage account.
1. Function sends data from queue to Azure Storage.
1. Globally-relevant and compliant insights are available in the global app.
