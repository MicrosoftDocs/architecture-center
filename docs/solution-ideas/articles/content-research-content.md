This architecture describes how [knowledge mining](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/knowledge-mining/) can be used for content research.

When organizations task employees to review and research of technical data, it can be tedious to read page after page of dense text. Knowledge mining helps employees quickly review these dense materials. In industries where bidding competition is fierce, or when the diagnosis of a problem must be quick or in near real-time, companies can use knowledge mining to avoid costly mistakes and gain faster insights during content research.

## Data flow in knowledge mining

There are three steps in knowledge mining: ingest, enrich, and explore.

- **Ingest**

  The ingest step aggregates content from a range of sources, including structured and unstructured data. For content research, you can ingest different types of technical content like product manuals, user guides, engineering standard documents, patent records, medical journals, and pharmaceutical fillings.

- **Enrich**

  The enrich step uses AI capabilities to extract information, find patterns, and deepen understanding. Enrich your content using optical character recognition, key phrase extraction, entity recognition, and language translation. Use custom models to extract industry-specific terms such as product names or engineering standards, to flag potential risks or other essential information, or for HIPAA compliance.

- **Explore**

  The explore step is exploring data via search, bots, applications, and data visualizations. For example, you can integrate the search index Azure Cognitive Search into a searchable directory or an existing business application.

## Components

Key technologies used to implement tools for technical content review and research

- [Azure Cognitive Search](/azure/search/)
- [Microsoft Text Analytics API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/)
