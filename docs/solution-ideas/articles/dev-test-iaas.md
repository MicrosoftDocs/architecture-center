# Dev-Test deployment for testing IaaS solutions

[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

This architecture represents how to configure your infrastructure for development and testing of a standard IaaS-based SaaS system.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops), [Azure DevTest Labs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devtest-lab), [Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) and Application Insights. These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Architecture

## Components

* [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops) manages the development process.
* The [Microsoft Release Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/getting-started/configure-agents) build and release agents deploy the Azure Resource Manager template and associated code to the various environments.
* [Azure DevOps resource groups](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/release/getting-started/configure-agents) are used to define all the services required to deploy the solution into a dev-test or production environment.
* [Azure DevTest Labs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devtest-lab): Azure Dev-Test Labs manages all of the virtual machines used in the development and test environments.
* [Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines): Virtual machines are used to deploy all of the products used in the solution. Staging slots swap pre-production and production versions.
* Application Insights: Application Insights monitors the web application during development and test runs, and then monitors the full production system when itâ€™s released.
