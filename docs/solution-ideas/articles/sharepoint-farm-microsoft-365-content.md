This solution provides a highly available deployment of SharePoint using a load balanced Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), highly available SQL always on instance, and highly available SharePoint resources. It addresses the need to deliver highly available intranet capability using the latest and greatest supported platforms.

## Architecture

## Data Flow

1. Create resource group to host all Azure based infrastructure and services.
1. Create virtual network in Azure.
1. Deploy Windows Servers to host Active Directory services for SharePoint and SQL server service accounts and machine accounts.
1. Deploy SQL Server Always on for HA support for the SharePoint farm.
1. Deploy SharePoint Severs. In this scenario we are using 2 Frontend with Distributed Cache and 2 Application with Search roles. This give us high availability.
1. Install Azure AD Connect on an on-premises server to synchronize your identities to Azure Active Directory.
1. Optionally configure Active Directory Federation Services on premises to support federated authentication to Microsoft 365.
1. Deploy ExpressRoute or setup a site-to-site VPN link for administrative access to the servers hosted in Azure IaaS.
1. Setup and provision external access to the Hybrid farm hosted in Azure IaaS
1. Setup and configure Hybrid Workloads between Microsoft 365 and the SharePoint farm.
