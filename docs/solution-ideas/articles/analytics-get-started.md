With the exponential growth in data, organizations rely on the limitless compute, storage, and analytical power of Azure to scale, stream, predict, and see their data. Analytics solutions turn volumes of data into useful business intelligence (BI), such as reports and visualizations, and inventive artificial intelligence (AI), such as forecasts based on machine learning.

Whether your organization is just starting to evaluate cloud-based analytics tools or is looking to expand your current implementation, Azure provides many options. The workflow starts with learning about common approaches and aligning processes and roles around a cloud mindset.

Data can be processed in batches or in real-time, on-premises or in the cloud, but the goal of any analytics solution is to make use of data at scale. Increasingly, organizations want to create a single source of truth for all the relational and nonrelational data being generated by people, machines, and the Internet of Things (IoT). It's common to use a [big data architecture](../../guide/architecture-styles/big-data.md) or an [IoT architecture](../../guide/architecture-styles/big-data.md#iot-architecture) to transform raw data into a structured form, then move it to an analytical data store. This store becomes the single source of truth that can power a multitude of insightful analytics solutions.

These are some of the key analytics services available on Azure:

- [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/). A unified analytics platform that brings together data engineering, data integration, data warehousing, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence.
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/). An integrated analytics service that combines data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics.
- [Azure Databricks](/azure/databricks/). An Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Azure cloud services platform.
- [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/). A data analytics service optimized for real-time analysis on large volumes of streaming data.
- [Power BI](/power-bi/). A suite of business analytics tools that deliver insights throughout your organization.

## Learn about analytics on Azure

If you're new to analytics on Azure, the best place to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn](/training/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free, online training platform. You'll find videos, tutorials, and hands-on learning for specific products and services, plus learning paths based on your job role, such as developer or data analyst.

Here are some resources to get you started:

- [Browse Azure data topics](/training/browse/?products=azure&filter-products=data&terms=data)
- [Explore Azure database and analytics services](/training/modules/azure-database-fundamentals/)
- [Learning path: Azure Data Fundamentals](/training/paths/azure-data-fundamentals-explore-core-data-concepts/)
- [Learning path: Implement a data analytics solution with Azure Databricks](/training/paths/data-engineer-azure-databricks/)
- [Learning path: Get started with Microsoft Fabric](/training/paths/get-started-fabric/)


### Learning paths by role

- **Data analyst**: [Data analytics with Microsoft Fabric](/training/paths/get-started-with-data-analytics-for-business-intelligence/)
- **Data engineer**: [Build data analytics solutions using Azure Databricks](/training/paths/data-engineer-azure-databricks/)
- **Data scientist**: [Perform data science with Azure Databricks](/training/paths/perform-data-science-azure-databricks/)

## Organizational readiness

If your organization is new to the cloud, the [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) can help you get started. This collection of documentation and best practices offers proven guidance from Microsoft designed to accelerate your cloud adoption journey.

Specific guidance for analytics includes:

- [Innovation tools to democratize data in Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/data)
- [Data management and analytics scenario](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/data-management/)
- [Analytics workloads for the cloud](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/data-management/architectures/)

To help assure the quality of your analytics solution on Azure, we recommend following the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/). It provides prescriptive guidance for organizations seeking architectural excellence and discusses how to design, provision, and monitor cost-optimized Azure solutions.

For analytics-specific guidance:

- [Azure Well-Architected Framework for data workloads](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/)
- [Reliability design principles](/azure/well-architected/reliability/principles)
- [Security design principles for data workloads](/azure/well-architected/security/principles)

## Path to production

Knowing how to [store your data](../../data-guide/technology-choices/analytical-data-stores.md) is one of the first decisions you need to make in your journey to analytics on Azure. Then you can choose the best [data analytics technology](../../data-guide/technology-choices/analysis-visualizations-reporting.md) for your scenario.

Key decision points include:

- **Data storage**: Choose between data lakes, data warehouses, or lakehouses based on your data structure and query patterns.
- **Processing model**: Determine whether batch processing, stream processing, or a combination best fits your workload requirements.
- **Analytics tools**: Select BI and AI technologies that align with your team's skills and business needs.

To get started, consider the following example implementations:

- [Analytics end-to-end with Microsoft Fabric](../../example-scenario/dataplate2e/data-platform-end-to-end.yml) - A comprehensive approach to building a unified analytics platform using Microsoft Fabric's integrated capabilities.

- [Databases architecture design](../../databases/index.yml) - Guidance for selecting and designing database solutions that power analytics workloads.

- [Data warehousing and analytics](../../example-scenario/data/data-warehouse.yml) - A traditional data warehouse pattern for structured analytics and reporting.

- [Stream processing with Azure Databricks](../../reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-databricks.yml) - Real-time analytics using Apache Spark-based processing.

- [Stream processing with Azure Stream Analytics](../../reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-stream-analytics.yml) - Serverless real-time analytics for IoT and event data.

## Best practices

High-quality analytics start with robust, trustworthy data. At the highest level, [information security](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview) practices help ensure that your data is protected in transit and at rest. Access to that data must also be trusted. Trustworthy data implies a design that implements:

- [Governance policies](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-governance) - Define clear data ownership, classification, and access policies.

- [Identity and access management](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity) - Implement role-based access control and least-privilege principles.

- [Network security controls](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network) - Protect data flows between services and prevent unauthorized access.

- [Data protection](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage) - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

At the platform level, the following [big data best practices](../../guide/architecture-styles/big-data.md#best-practices) contribute to trustworthy analytics on Azure:

- **Orchestrate data ingestion** - Use a data workflow or pipeline solution such as those supported by Azure Data Factory or Microsoft Fabric pipelines.

- **Process data in place** - Use a distributed data store, a big data approach that supports larger volumes of data and a wider range of formats.

- **Scrub sensitive data early** - Remove or mask sensitive data as part of the ingestion workflow to avoid storing it in your data lake.

- **Consider total cost** - Balance the per-unit cost of the compute nodes needed against the per-minute cost of using those nodes to complete a job.

- **Create a unified data lake** - Combine storage for files in multiple formats, whether structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Use Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as your single source of truth. For example, see [BI solution architecture in the Center of Excellence](/power-bi/guidance/center-of-excellence-business-intelligence-solution-architecture).
