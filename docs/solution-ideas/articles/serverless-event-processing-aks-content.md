This article describes a variation of a [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/) event-driven architecture running on Azure Kubernetes with KEDA scaler that ingests a stream of data, processes the data, and then writes the results to a back-end database.

To learn more about the basic concepts, considerations, and approaches for serverless event processing, consult the [Serverless event processing](../../reference-architectures/serverless/event-processing.yml) reference architecture.

## Potential use case

A popular use case for implementing an end-to-end event stream processing pattern includes the Event Hubs streaming ingestion service to receive and process events per second using a de-batching and transformation logic implemented with highly scalable, event hub-triggered functions.

## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with the KEDA scaler is used to autoscale Azure Functions containers based on the number of events needing to be processed.
1. Events arrive at the Input Event Hub.
1. The De-batching and Filtering Azure Function is triggered to handle the event. This step filters out unwanted events and de-batches the received events before submitting to the Output Event Hub.
1. If the De-batching and Filtering Azure Function fails to store the event successfully, the event is submitted to the Deadletter Event Hub 1.
1. Events arriving at the Output Event Hub trigger the Transforming Azure Function. This Azure Function transforms the event into a message for the Cosmos DB.
1. The event is stored in a Cosmos DB database.

### Components

- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service) (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance.
- [KEDA](https://keda.sh) is an event-driven autoscaler used to scale containers in the Kubernetes cluster based on the number of events needing to be processed.
- [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs) ingests the data stream. Event Hubs is designed for high-throughput data streaming scenarios.
- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions) is a serverless compute option. It uses an event-driven model, where a piece of code (a *function*) is invoked by a trigger.
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db) is a multi-model database service that is available in a serverless, consumption-based mode. For this scenario, the event-processing function stores JSON records, using the [Cosmos DB SQL API](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> For Internet of Thing (IoT) scenarios, we recommend [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub). IoT Hub has a built-in endpoint that's compatible with the Azure Event Hubs API, so you can use either service in this architecture with no major changes in the back-end processing. For more information, see [Connecting IoT Devices to Azure: IoT Hub and Event Hubs](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs).
