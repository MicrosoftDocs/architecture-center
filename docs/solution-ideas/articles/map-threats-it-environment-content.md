This article outlines how to diagram your organization's core IT environment and create a threat map. These diagrams are valuable tools for planning and building a robust defensive security layer. Understanding your IT environment and its architecture is crucial for identifying the security services needed to provide adequate protection.

Computer systems hold information that is not only valuable to the organizations that generate it but also to malicious actors. These actors, whether individuals or groups, engage in harmful activities aimed at compromising or damaging the computers, devices, systems, and networks of companies. Their goal is often to steal or corrupt sensitive data using threats like malware or brute force attacks.

In this article, we explore a method for mapping threats to your IT environment, enabling you to plan the implementation of Microsoft security services as part of your security strategy. 

The good news is that you don’t need to create a threat map from scratch. The MITRE ATT&CK matrix offers an excellent resource to help you develop one. MITRE ATT&CK is a global knowledge base that maps real-world threats based on observed tactics and techniques. The MITRE Corporation documents every known threat in detail, providing valuable insights into how these threats operate and how you can defend against them. This publicly accessible resource is available online at MITRE ATT&CK®.

In this article, we use a subset of these threats to illustrate how you can map threats to your IT environment.

## Potential use cases

Some threats are common across all industries, such as ransomware, DDoS attacks, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection. However, many organizations face specific threats unique to their industry or based on past cyberattacks they’ve encountered. The diagram in this article can help you map those threats for your organization by identifying the areas most likely to be targeted by malicious actors. Creating a threat map enables you to plan the necessary defense layers for a more secure environment.

You can adapt this diagram to model different combinations of attacks and better understand how to prevent and mitigate them. While the MITRE ATT&CK framework is a useful reference, it’s not required. Microsoft Sentinel and other Microsoft security services also collaborate with MITRE to provide valuable insights into various threats.

Some organizations use Cyber Kill Chain®, a methodology from Lockheed Martin, to map and understand how an attack or a series of attacks are performed against an IT environment. Cyber Kill Chain organizes threats and attacks by considering fewer tactics and techniques than the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Still, it's effective in helping you to understand threats and how they might be executed. For more information about this methodology, see [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html).

The diagram represents Microsoft 365 through the components listed in the following table.

| Label | Description | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| `OFFICE 365` | Microsoft 365 services (formerly Office 365). The applications that Microsoft 365 makes available depends on the type of license. | [Microsoft 365 - Subscription for Office Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) |
| `Microsoft Entra ID` | Microsoft Entra ID, the same one utilized by Azure. Many companies use the same Microsoft Entra service for Azure and Microsoft 365. | [What is Microsoft Entra ID?](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) |

### Workflow

To help you understand which part of your IT environment those threats are likely to attack, the architecture diagram in this article is based on a typical IT environment for an organization that has on-premises systems, a Microsoft 365 subscription, and an Azure subscription. The resources in each of these layers are services that are common to many companies. They're classified in the diagram according to the pillars of Microsoft Zero Trust: network, infrastructure, endpoint, application, data, and identity. For more information about Zero Trust, see [Embrace proactive security with Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust).

The architecture diagram includes the following layers:

1. **On-premises**

    The diagram includes some essential services such as servers (VMs), network appliances, and DNS. It includes common applications that are found in most IT environments and run on virtual machines or physical servers. It also includes various types of databases, both SQL and non-SQL. Organizations usually have a file server that shares files throughout the company. Lastly, the Active Directory Domain Service, a widespread infrastructure component, handles user credentials. The diagram includes all these components in the on-premises environment.

2. **Office 365 environment**

    This example environment contains traditional office applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Depending on the type of license, it might also include other applications, such as OneDrive, Exchange, Sharepoint, and Teams. In the diagram, these are represented by an icon for Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) apps and an icon for Microsoft Entra ID. Users must be authenticated to obtain access to Microsoft 365 applications, and Microsoft Entra ID acts as the identity provider. Microsoft 365 authenticates users against the same type of Microsoft Entra ID that Azure uses. In most organizations, the [Microsoft Entra ID *tenant*](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory) is the same for both Azure and Microsoft 365.

3. **Azure environment**

    This layer represents Azure public cloud services, including virtual machines, virtual networks, platforms as services, web applications, databases, storage, identity services, and more. For more information about Azure, see [Azure documentation](/azure).

4. **MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques**

    This diagram shows the top 16 threats, according to the tactics and techniques as published by The MITRE Corporation. In red lines, you can see an example of a blended attack, which means that a malicious actor might coordinate multiple attacks simultaneously.

### How to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework

You can start with a simple search for the name of the threat or of the attack code on the main web page, [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org).

You can also browse threats on the tactics or techniques pages:

- [Enterprise tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise)
- [Enterprise techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise)

You can still use [MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator), an intuitive tool provided by MITRE that helps you discover tactics, techniques, and details about threats.
