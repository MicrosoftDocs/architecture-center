This article explains how to diagram the essential IT environment of your organization and develop a threat map. These diagrams can help you to plan and build your defensive layer of security. Understanding your IT environment and how it's architected is essential to defining the security services that the environment requires for necessary levels of protection. 

Computer systems contain information that is valuable to the organizations that produce it—and to malicious actors. A malicious actor can be an individual or a group of people who perform malicious acts against a person or organization. Their efforts can cause harm to the computers, devices, systems, and networks of companies. Their goals are to compromise or steal valuable information by using threats like malware or brute force attacks.

In this article, we look at a way to map the threats against your IT environment so that you can plan how to use Microsoft security services to implement your security strategy. This is the second article in a series of five articles that are introduced in [Use Azure monitoring to integrate security components](../../guide/security/azure-monitor-integrate-security-components.yml). 

The good news is that you don't need to create a threat map from scratch. The MITRE ATT&CK matrix is a great solution to help you develop a threat map. MITRE ATT&CK is a global knowledge database that maps threats that are based on the tactics and techniques that are observed in the real world. The MITRE Corporation catalogs every threat available and discovers many details of how those threats work and how you can defend against them. It's a public service that you can access online at [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org).

This article uses a subset of those threats to present an example of how you could map threats against your IT environment.

## Potential use cases

Some threats are widespread regardless of the industry segment, such as ransomware, DDoS attacks, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and so on. However, some organizations have concerns about specific types of threats that are particular to their industry or that were the basis of cyber-attacks that they've experienced. The diagram presented in this article can help you map such threats for your organization according to the area that malicious actors are likely to attack. Developing a threat map helps you to plan the layers of defense that are necessary to have a more secure environment.

You can use this diagram with different combinations of attacks to understand how to avoid and mitigate those attacks. You don't necessarily need to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The framework is only an example. Microsoft Sentinel, and other Microsoft security services, have worked with MITRE to provide insightful information regarding threats.

Some organizations use Cyber Kill Chain®, a methodology from Lockheed Martin, to map and understand how an attack or a series of attacks are performed against an IT environment. Cyber Kill Chain organizes threats and attacks by considering fewer tactics and techniques than the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Still, it's effective in helping you to understand threats and how they might be executed. For more information about this methodology, see [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html).

For the IT environment of organizations, we specify the components only for Azure and Microsoft 365. Your specific IT environment might include devices, appliances, and technologies from different technology providers.

For the Azure environment, the diagram shows the components that are listed in the following table.

| Label | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **VNET** | [What is Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network)? |
| **LBS** | [What is Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)? |
| **PIPS** | [Public IP addresses](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses) |
| **SERVERS** | [Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) |
| **K8S** | [Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) |
| **VDI** | [What is Azure Virtual Desktop?](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview) |
| **WEB APPS** | [App Service overview](/azure/app-service/overview) |
| **AZURE STORAGE** | [Introduction to Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) |
| **DB** | [What is Azure SQL Database?](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview) |
| **AZURE AD** | [What is Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis)? |


The diagram represents Microsoft 365 through the components listed in the following table.

| Label | Description | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **OFFICE 365** | Microsoft 365 services (formerly Office 365). The applications that Microsoft 365 makes available depends on the type of license. | [Microsoft 365 - Subscription for Office Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) |
| **AZURE AD** | Azure AD, the same one utilized by Azure. Many companies use the same Azure AD service for Azure and Microsoft 365. | [What is Azure Active Directory?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) |

### Workflow

To help you understand which part of your IT environment those threats are likely to attack, the architecture diagram in this article is based on a typical IT environment for an organization that has on-premises systems, a Microsoft 365 subscription, and an Azure subscription. The resources in each of these layers are services that are common to many companies. They're classified in the diagram according to the pillars of Microsoft Zero Trust: network, infrastructure, endpoint, application, data, and identity. For more information about Zero Trust, see [Embrace proactive security with Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust).

The architecture diagram includes the following layers:

1.  **On-premises**

    The diagram includes some essential services such as servers (VMs), network appliances, and DNS. It includes common applications that are found in most IT environments and run on virtual machines or physical servers. It also includes various types of databases, both SQL and non-SQL. Organizations usually have a file server that shares files throughout the company. Lastly, the Active Directory Domain Service, a widespread infrastructure component, handles user credentials. The diagram includes all these components in the on-premises environment.

2.  **Office 365 environment**

    This example environment contains traditional office applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Depending on the type of license, it might also include other applications, such as OneDrive, Exchange, Sharepoint, and Teams. In the diagram, these are represented by an icon for Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) apps and an icon for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Users must be authenticated to obtain access to Microsoft 365 applications, and Azure AD acts as the identity provider. Microsoft 365 authenticates users against the same type of Azure AD that Azure uses. In most organizations, the [Azure AD *tenant*](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory) is the same for both Azure and Microsoft 365.

3.  **Azure environment**

    This layer represents Azure public cloud services, including virtual machines, virtual networks, platforms as services, web applications, databases, storage, identity services, and more. For more information about Azure, see [Azure documentation](/azure).

4.  **MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques** 
 
    This diagram shows the top 16 threats, according to the tactics and techniques as published by The MITRE Corporation. In red lines, you can see an example of a blended attack, which means that a malicious actor might coordinate multiple attacks simultaneously.

### How to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework

You can start with a simple search for the name of the threat or of the attack code on the main web page, [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org).

You can also browse threats on the tactics or techniques pages:

  - [Enterprise tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise)
  - [Enterprise techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise)

You can still use [MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator), an intuitive tool provided by MITRE that helps you discover tactics, techniques, and details about threats.

### Components

The example architecture in this article uses the following Azure components:

- [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD helps your users to access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. It also helps them access internal resources, like apps on your corporate intranet network.
