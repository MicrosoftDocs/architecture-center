Learn how Microsoft Azure can help accurately forecast spikes in demand for energy products and services to give your company a competitive advantage.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics), [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs), [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning), [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory), and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Architecture

*Download an [SVG](../media/forecast-energy-power-demand.svg) of this architecture.*

## Components

* [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory): Handle data manipulation and preparation.
* [Azure Automated Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/automatedml): Use Azure ML to forecast the energy demand of a particular region.
* [MLOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/mlops): Design, deploy, and manage production model workflows.
* [Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/service-aml-integrate): Consume model prediction results in Power BI.
