## Data flow

1. Users interact with Bot through mobile app or web app.
1. Bot understands user intent and conversational context by using LUIS, which is built into the application.
1. Bot passes visual context (that is, image) to the Bing Visual Search API.
1. Bot gets additional information from Bing Entity Search for rich context on people, place, artwork, monument, and objects.
1. Bot gets additional information for barcodes.
1. Optionally, Bot gets more information on barcodes/queries exclusively from your domain through the Bing Custom Search API.
1. Visual Assistant renders similar products/destinations from your domain or provides more information around celebrity/place/monuments/artworks.
