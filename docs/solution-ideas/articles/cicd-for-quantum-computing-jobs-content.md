[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

Introductory section (no heading)
The introduction contains:

- A paragraph that describes what the solution does (the domain)
- A paragraph that contains a brief description of the main Azure services that make up the solution. This paragraph should convey the Azure value proposition, not a complete description of the architecture.

## Potential use cases

> Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?
> How similar or different are they to what's in this article?

These other uses cases have similar design patterns:

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](../media/cicd-for-quantum-computing-jobs.png)

After the architecture diagram, include a numbered list that describes the data flow or workflow through the solution. Explain what each step does. Start from the user or external data source, and then follow the flow through the rest of the solution.

### Components

A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product service pages. This is for lead generation (what business, marketing, and PG want). It helps drive revenue.

> Why is each component there?
> What does it do and why was it necessary?

- Example: [Resource Groups][resource-groups] is a logical container for Azure resources.  We use resource groups to organize everything related to this project in the Azure console.

## Next steps

Links to articles on the AAC, and other Docs articles. Could also be to appropriate sources outside of Docs, such as GitHub repos or an official technical blog post.

## Related resources

Another optional link list, in bulleted form. If you have several links to other articles in Docs, include those in "Next steps" and use "Related resources" for related architecture guides and architectures.
