Extract, transform, and load your big data clusters on demand with Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## Potential use cases

Azure HDInsight can be used for various scenarios in big data processing. It can be historical data (data that's already collected and stored) or real-time data (data that's directly streamed from the source). The scenarios for processing such data can be summarized in the following doc, [Scenarios for using HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-overview#scenarios-for-using-hdinsight). This solution idea covers the data flow for an ETL use case.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](../media/extract-transform-and-load-using-hdinsight.png)

### Dataflow

The data flows through the architecture as follows:

1. Using Azure Data Factory, establish [Linked Services](/azure/data-factory/concepts-linked-services) to source systems and data stores. Azure Data Factory Pipelines support 90+ connectors that also include generic protocols for data sources where a native connector isn't available.

1. Load data from source systems into Azure data lake with the [Copy Data tool](/azure/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-copy-data-tool#start-the-copy-data-tool).

1. Azure Data Factory is able to create an on-demand HDInsight cluster. Start by creating an [On-Demand HDInsight Linked Service](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf#create-an-on-demand-hdinsight-linked-service). Next, [create a pipeline](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-adf#create-a-pipeline) and use the appropriate HDInsight activity depending on the Hadoop framework being used (that is, Hive, MapReduce, Spark, etc.).

1. Trigger the pipeline in Azure Data Factory. The architecture assumes Azure Data Lake store is used as the file system in the Hadoop script executed by the HDInsight activity which was created in Step 3. The script will be executed by an on-demand HDInsight cluster that will write data to a curated area of the data lake.

### Components
