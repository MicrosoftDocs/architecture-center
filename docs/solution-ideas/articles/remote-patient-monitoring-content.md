### Dataflow

1. Securely ingest medical sensor and device data using Azure IoT Hub.
1. Securely store sensor and device data in Cosmos DB.
1. Analyze sensor and device data using a pre-trained Cognitive Services API or a custom developed Machine Learning model.
1. Store Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning results in Cosmos DB.
1. Interact AI and Machine Learning results using Power BI, while preserving Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
1. Integrate data insights with backend systems and processes using Logic Apps.
