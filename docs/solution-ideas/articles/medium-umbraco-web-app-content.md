Medium Umbraco CMS web app configured to scale and optimal for high-traffic sites. It uses two web apps, one for your front-end app and the other for your back-office app, deployed in a single region with autoscaling enabled.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), [Storage Accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage), Application Insights and [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, which allows you to focus on your solution instead of the environment it runs in.

### Components

* Run an Umbraco CMS on the [Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web) feature of Azure App Service with the front-end and back-office apps running on the same app.
* Store your site's content in [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database). The back-office web app and front-end web app use the same database. Use [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database)'s features such as backup and high availability.
* [Storage Accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage): Store all your media in Azure Storage, so you can reduce I/O operation on the web app file server and improve performance.
* Application Insights: Detect issues, diagnose crashes, and track usage in your web app with Application Insights. Make informed decisions throughout the development lifecycle.
* Store session state and output cache on [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache) to improve performance and reduce the load on your web front ends.
