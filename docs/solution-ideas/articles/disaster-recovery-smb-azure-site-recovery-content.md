Small and medium businesses can inexpensively implement disaster recovery to the cloud by using Azure Site Recovery or a partner solution like Double-Take DR.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager), [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery) and [Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Components

* DNS traffic is routed via [Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager) which can easily move traffic from one site to another based on policies defined by your organization.
* [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery) orchestrates the replication of machines and manages the configuration of the failback procedures.
* [Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network): The virtual network is where the failover site will be created when a disaster occurs.
* [Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs) stores the replica images of all machines that are protected by Site Recovery.
