This example demonstrates how you can deploy portals that automate manual or paper-based processes and surface a rich user experience. Employ Azure API management and Azure Functions to connect custom APIs, which tap into your legacy systems. By using Azure-managed databases and a low-code approach to automating tasks, you can lower the overall solution costs while quickly building apps that are real-time, resilient, and scalable by default.

### Dataflow

The data flows through the solution as follows:

1. The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in [Azure API Management](/azure/api-management).
1. A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system, assigning flights to Microsoft Teams channels and sending them to [Power Apps](/power-apps).
1. When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
1. [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions) runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/) for further analytics.
1. The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs [Azure Bot Service](/azure/bot-service).
1. Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
1. An [Azure Data Lake](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

### Components

Data is loaded from these different data sources using several Azure components:

- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a suite of business analytics tools to analyze data and share insights.

## Scenario details

### Potential use cases

The use of digital workflows isn't limited to any one industry. Document-based digital workflows use the same components but arrange them differently to meet the requirements of a process. Examples of industries that can benefit from automated processes include, but are not limited to:

- Manufacturing
- Healthcare
- Education
- Finance
- Law firms
- Airlines (aerospace)
