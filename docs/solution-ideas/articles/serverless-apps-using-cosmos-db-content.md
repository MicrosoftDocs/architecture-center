You can use Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB to build globally distributed, scalable serverless applications.

### Dataflow

- A customer places an order in an e-commerce website.
- The order triggers an instance of Functions. The function processes the customer's checkout and stores information about the order in Azure Cosmos DB.
- The database insert operation triggers an Azure Cosmos DB change feed event.
- Systems that subscribe to change feed events are notified.
- The change feed notifications trigger Functions:

  - A function applies taxes to the order.
  - A function processes payment for the order.
  - A function fulfills the order.

### Components

- [Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions) is an event-driven serverless compute platform. With Functions, you can use triggers and bindings to integrate services at scale.
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db) is a globally distributed, multi-model database. With Azure Cosmos DB, your solutions can elastically scale throughput and storage across any number of geographic regions.

## Scenario details

Microservices offer many benefits:

- They provide highly scalable solutions.
- You can deploy each service independently.
- Fault isolation is straightforward when you confine functionality to separate containers.
- They fit well in a DevOps environment.
- They decrease time to market by speeding up the software development lifecycle.

An efficient way to implement microservices is to use a serverless technology. This solution uses Functions, an Azure offering that provides a serverless compute experience. The solution uses Azure Cosmos DB for data storage. Azure Cosmos DB offers a change feed that integrates with Functions.

### Potential use cases

This solution applies to many areas:

- E-commerce
- Retail
- Inventory management
