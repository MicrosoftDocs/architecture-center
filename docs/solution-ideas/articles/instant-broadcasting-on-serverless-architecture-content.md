### Data flow

1. Client pulls web app content from blob storage
1. Web app receives SignalR token and endpoint
1. User connects to web app
1. Connection triggers database event via Functions
1. Functions pushes data to SignalR Service
1. â€¦which in turn pushes data to client

### Components

- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs): Stores large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or to store application data privately.
- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/): Build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs without managing infrastructure.
- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) is a serverless compute option. It uses an event-driven model, where a piece of code (a *function*) is invoked by a trigger.
- [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) provides asynchronous communication between the client and the server. It supports any scenario that requires pushing data from server to client in real time.
- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database) is a fully managed relational database with built-in intelligence.
