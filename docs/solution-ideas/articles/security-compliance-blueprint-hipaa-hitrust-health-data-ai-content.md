Store, manage, and analyze HIPAA-compliant and HITRUST-compliant health data and medical records with the highest level of built-in security.

## Potential use cases

This solution is ideal for the medical and healthcare industry.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram shows data sources ingested, stored, analyzed by machine learning, and displayed to user via Power B I.](../media/security-compliance-blueprint-hipaa-hitrust-health-data-ai.png)

### Dataflow

1. Securely ingest bulk patient data into [Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs).
1. [Event Grid](/azure/event-grid) publishes patient data to [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions) for processing, and securely stores patient data in SQL Database.
1. Analyze patient data using [Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning), and create a Machine Learning-trained model.
1. Ingest new patient data in HL7/FHIR format and publish to Azure Functions for processing. Store in [SQL Database](/azure/sql-database).
1. Analyze newly ingested data using the trained Machine Learning model.
1. Interact with patient data using Power BI while preserving Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
