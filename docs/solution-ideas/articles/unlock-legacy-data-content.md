## Data Flow

1. User enters data into Azure-based web app.
1. Application commits data to database over virtual network-to-virtual network VPN connection to Azure Stack.
1. Data is processed by applications running on a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Stack.
1. Kubernetes cluster communicates with legacy system on corporate network.

## Components
