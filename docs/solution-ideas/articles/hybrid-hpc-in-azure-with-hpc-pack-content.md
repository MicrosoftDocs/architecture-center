Microsoft HPC Pack is a free high performance computing (HPC) solution built on Microsoft Azure and Windows Server technologies. HPC Pack combines a comprehensive set of deployment, administration, job scheduling, and monitoring tools for your Windows and Linux HPC cluster environment, providing a flexible platform for developing and running HPC applications on premises and in Azure.

This solution shows the process for using HPC Pack to create a hybrid (on-premises and Azure) HPC environment.

The links below provide documentation on deploying and managing the Azure products that are included in this solution idea:

## Data Flow

1. Log into on-premises head node
1. Add Azure compute nodes to the cluster
1. Start the compute nodes
1. Submit jobs to the cluster
1. HPC Pack sends jobs to on-premises and Azure nodes based upon the node group selected
1. Monitor job progress
1. Stop the compute nodes or configure auto-scaling
