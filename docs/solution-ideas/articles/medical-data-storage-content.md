*Download an [SVG](../media/medical-data-storage.svg) of this architecture.*

## Data Flow

1. Securely ingest medical image data using Azure Data Factory.
1. Securely store medical image data in Azure Data Lake Store and/or Azure Blob Storage.
1. Analyze medical image data using a pre-trained Azure Cognitive Services API or a custom developed Machine Learning model.
1. Store artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning results in Azure Data Lake.
1. Interact AI and Machine Learning results using PowerBI, while preserving Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
1. Securely interact with medical image data via a web based vendor neutral archive (VNA) image viewer.
