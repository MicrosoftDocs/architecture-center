You can build an entire IT infrastructure to run your organization by using various Azure services. Azure also offers security services to protect your infrastructure. By using Azure security services, you can improve the security posture of your IT environment. You can mitigate vulnerabilities and avoid breaches by implementing a well-architected solution that follows recommendations from Microsoft. 

Some security services incur fees while others have no additional charges. Free services include network security groups (NSGs), storage encryption, TLS/SSL, shared access signature tokens, and many others. This article covers such services.

This article is the third in a series of five. To review the previous two articles in this series, including the introduction and a review of how you can map threats against an IT environment, see the following articles:

- [Use Azure monitoring to integrate security components](../../guide/security/azure-monitor-integrate-security-components.yml)
- [Map threats to your IT environment](./map-threats-it-environment.yml)

## Potential use cases

This article presents Azure security services according to each Azure service. In this way, you can think of a specific threat against resource—a virtual machine (VM), an operating system, an Azure network, an application—or an attack that might compromise users and passwords. Then use the diagram in this article to help you understand which Azure security services to use to protect resources and user identities from that type of threat.

The Azure security layer in this diagram is based on Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) v3, which is a set of security rules that are implemented through Azure policies. ASB is based on a combination of rules from [CIS Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org) and [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov). For more information about ASB, see [Overview of the Azure Security Benchmark v3](/security/benchmark/azure/overview).

The diagram doesn't contain all the Azure security services that are available, but it shows the security services that are most commonly used by organizations. All the security services that are identified in the architectural diagram can work together in any combination according to your IT environment and your organization's security requirements.


### Workflow

This section describes the components and services that appear in the diagram. Many of those are labeled with their ASB control codes, in addition to their abbreviated labels.

### Components

The example architecture in this article uses the following Azure components:

- [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD helps your users to access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. It also helps them access internal resources, like apps on your corporate intranet network.

- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Virtual Network provides a virtual network that benefits from Azure's infrastructure, such as scale, availability, and isolation.

- [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer) is a high-performance, low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring that your solution is highly available. Azure Load Balancer is zone-redundant, ensuring high availability across Availability Zones.

- [Virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. An Azure virtual machine (VM) gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it.

- [Azure Kubernetes service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service) (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service for deploying and managing containerized applications. AKS provides serverless Kubernetes, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and enterprise-grade security and governance.

- [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud to provide desktops for remote users.

- [Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web) is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, and applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/storage) is highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for various data objects in the cloud, including object, blob, file, disk, queue, and table storage. All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.

- [Azure SQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database) is a fully managed PaaS database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring. It provides these functions without user involvement. SQL Database provides a range of built-in security and compliance features to help your application meet security and compliance requirements.
