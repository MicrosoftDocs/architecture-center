You can use a various Azure services to create a complete IT infrastructure for your organization. Azure also provides security services that can help you protect your infrastructure. By using Azure security solutions, you can enhance your IT environment's security posture, mitigate vulnerabilities, and protect against breaches via a well-architected solution that's based on Microsoft best practices.

Although some security services incur associated costs, many are available at no additional charge. Free services include network security groups (NSGs), storage encryption, TLS/SSL, shared access signature tokens, and more. This article focuses on these cost-free services.

This article is the third in a series of five. To review the previous two articles in this series, including the introduction and a review of how you can map threats against an IT environment, see the following article:

- [Map threats to your IT environment](./map-threats-it-environment.yml)

## Potential use cases

This article organizes Azure security services by Azure resource so you can focus on specific threats that target resources like virtual machines (VMs), operating systems, Azure networks, or applications, in addition to attacks that can compromise users and passwords. The following diagram can help you identify the Azure security services that help protect resources and user identities against these types of threats.

## Architecture

The Azure security layer in this diagram is based on Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) v3, which is a set of security rules that are implemented through Azure policies. ASB is based on a combination of rules from [CIS Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org) and [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov). For more information about ASB, see [Overview of the Azure Security Benchmark v3](/security/benchmark/azure/overview).

The diagram doesn't include every Azure security service available, but it does highlight the services that are used most commonly. All the security services shown in the architectural diagram can be combined and configured to work together with your IT environment and your organization's specific security needs.

### Workflow

This section describes the components and services that appear in the diagram. Many of those are labeled with their ASB control codes, in addition to their abbreviated labels. The control codes correspond to the control domains that are listed in [Controls](/security/benchmark/azure/overview#controls). 

1. **Azure Security Benchmark**

    Each security control refers to one or more specific Azure security services. The architecture reference in this article shows some of them and their control numbers according to the ASB documentation. The controls include:

    - Network security
    - Identity management
    - Privileged access
    - Data protection
    - Asset management
    - Logging and threat detection
    - Incident response
    - Posture and vulnerability management
    - Endpoint security
    - Backup and recovery
    - DevOps security
    - Governance and strategy

### Components

The example architecture in this article uses the following Azure components:

- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Microsoft Entra ID helps your users to access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. It also helps them access internal resources, like apps on your corporate intranet network.

- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Virtual Network provides a virtual network that benefits from Azure's infrastructure, such as scale, availability, and isolation.

- [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer) is a high-performance, low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring that your solution is highly available. Azure Load Balancer is zone-redundant, ensuring high availability across Availability Zones.

- [Virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) are one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. An Azure virtual machine (VM) gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it.

- [Azure Kubernetes service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service) is a fully managed Kubernetes service for deploying and managing containerized applications. AKS provides serverless Kubernetes, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and enterprise-grade security and governance.

- [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud to provide desktops for remote users.

- [App Service Web Apps](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/app-service-web-apps) is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, and applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/storage) is highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for various data objects in the cloud, including object, blob, file, disk, queue, and table storage. All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.

- [Azure SQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database) is a fully managed PaaS database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring. It provides these functions without user involvement. SQL Database provides a range of built-in security and compliance features to help your application meet security and compliance requirements.
