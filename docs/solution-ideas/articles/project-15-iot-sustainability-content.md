## About Project 15 Open Platform

The goal with [Project 15 Open Platform][Project 15 from Microsoft] is to bring the latest Microsoft cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to accelerate scientific teams building sustainability and conservation solutions like species tracking & observation, poaching prevention, ecosystem monitoring, pollution detection, etc.

The core goals of the P15 Open Platform are:

* Close the Skill Gap Boost innovation with a ready-made platform, allowing the scientific developer to expand into specific use cases.
* Increase Speed to Deployment Open Platform get teams 80% of the way with their projects, dramatically reducing the time to start building crucial insights.
* Lower the development cost The Open Platform lowers the cost of overall development and reduces complexity. Opens up opportunities for partnering with the Open Source developer community and universities.

Currently maintained by developers at Microsoft, Project 15â€™s Open Platform is not an official product from Microsoft.

## Architecture

The following sections provide insight into Project 15 Open Platform functionality and architecture.

Diagram showing components and functionality of the Project 15 Open Platform. Bars show areas of functionality, such as user management and security. Boxes represent actions that the platform handles like connect devices and ingest data. Between the boxes are arrows that indicate the flow of data in the system. The components are color coded. Light green elements are fully included in the platform. Dark green elements are included but need customization. Blue elements aren't included by default and require full customization. Images of animals and plants connected to sensors and trackers are also visible. Arrows indicate that their data flows into the system, and the system can manage these devices.

### Solution Overview

The solution has three main categories:

* **Components that are fully included**

These are Azure services that if someone was standing up the solution these parts of the infrastructure only need to be deployed once and then expanded as devices get added to the solution. To learn all the ins and outs of these services is a lift and would take time. Our theory here is that by this method, the technologist doesn't need to know every nitty-gritty detail and can expand their learning as needed. For learning about building an IoT Solution, a great resource to ramp up quickly on the concepts with real world examples and labs is available at [Internet of Things Learning Path](Internet of Things Learning Path). Of course, if one wants to learn all the details, Microsoft Learn's [Introduction to Azure IoT](Introduction to Azure IoT) has all you need. All our learning resources here, are free to you.

* **Included Components but needs customization**

Here the solution will deploy these services for you, but you will start to modify and add to them based on your use case. The details of the services here are all explained in our [Project 15 Open Platform Developer Guide][Project 15 Open Platform Developer Guide]. The high level architecture of what services are involved, see below.

* **Not Included, requires full customization**

This is the part where your IP will reside.  How this works is once you `Deploy` the solution to your own Azure account, **it is yours to build out**. Think of how you use a word processor. The word processor is a tool and the book you write, is yours. Meaning the story you publish is yours, the revenue generated is yours. Same idea. This solution is a tool for you to use to write your own solutions.

Various Azure services and configurations make up the Project 15 Open Platform:

1. The Azure IoT Hub device provisioning service provisions IoT devices and connects them to IoT Hub.

1. Streaming platforms and services build the data pipeline that's necessary for basic telemetry and event processing:

   - Azure Event Hubs ingests telemetry and events from IoT devices.
   - Azure Event Grid provides a publish-subscribe model that routes events.

1. Azure Stream Analytics analyzes data (**3a**). Azure Functions processes data (**3b**). And Azure Time Series Insights monitors, analyzes, and stores data (**3c**). These three services also feed data into a presentation layer.

1. Users connect to the presentation layer through browsers. In that layer:

   - Azure SignalR Service messaging provides real-time visualization.
   - Azure App Service and its Web Apps feature provide platforms for building, deploying, and scaling web apps.
   - Tools like Power BI visualize IoT devices, telemetry, and events in websites.
   - Tools like Power Apps and Power Automate solve the "app gap challenge" and proview low-code apps and automated workflows.

1. Databases, Azure Blob Storage, and tables store telemetry and file data from offices in the field.

1. Other Azure components provide more functionality:

   - Azure Functions and Azure API Management work to make device management events available in websites.
   - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) manages users.
   - API Management and Event Grid manage external data.
   - Azure Digital Twins offers modeling capabilities for optimizing operations.
   - Microsoft Defender for Cloud secures the solution by establishing security policies and access controls.
   - Azure Notification Hubs and Azure Logic Apps handle notifications.
   - Azure Machine Learning provides AI capabilities for forecasting device behavior.
   - Azure Maps tracks geofencing data to provide location-based services.

### Components
