Developers at Microsoft currently maintain Project 15 Open Platform, but it isn't an official Microsoft product.

The solution has three main categories:

* **Components that are fully included**

  Azure services make up the core infrastructure of the solution. You deploy these services only once, and then you expand them as you add devices to the solution. You don't need to fully understand these services to take advantage of the platform. To get a better understanding of these core components, see the following resources:

  - [Internet of Things event learning path][Internet of Things Learning Path]
  - [Introduction to Azure IoT][Introduction to Azure IoT]

* **Components that are included but need customization**

  The platform deploys these services for you, but you need to modify them to meet your solution's requirements. For more information on these services, see [Project 15 Open Platform developer guide][Project 15 Open Platform developer guide].

* **Components that aren't included and require full customization**

   You deploy the services to your own Azure account where you can then customize them to create your solution. Your IP address resides in this account.
