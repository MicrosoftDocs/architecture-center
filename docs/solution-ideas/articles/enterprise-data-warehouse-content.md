## Data flow

1. Combine all your structured, unstructured and semi-structured data (logs, files, and media) using Azure Synapse Analytics Pipelines to Azure Blob Storage.
1. Leverage data in Azure Blob Storage to perform scalable analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics Spark pool and achieve cleansed and transformed data.
1. Cleansed and transformed data can be combined with existing structured data, creating one hub for all your data with Azure Synapse Analytics.
1. Build operational reports and analytical dashboards on top of dedicated SQL pool to derive insights from the data, and use Azure Analysis Services to serve thousands of end users.
