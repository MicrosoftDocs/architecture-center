This article describes how to use image processing, natural language processing, and custom skills to capture domain-specific data. You can use that data to enrich text and image documents. Incorporate Azure AI Search with AI enrichment to help identify and explore relevant content at scale. This solution uses AI enrichment to extract meaning from the original complex, unstructured JFK Assassination Records (JFK Files) dataset.

### Dataflow

The following dataflow corresponds to the preceding diagram. The dataflow describes how the unstructured JFK Files dataset passes through the AI Search skills pipeline to produce structured and indexable data.

1. Unstructured data in Azure Blob Storage, such as documents and images, is ingested into AI Search.

1. To initiate the indexing process, the *document cracking* step extracts images and text from the data and then enriches the content. The enrichment steps in this process depend on the data and type of skills that you select.

1. [Built-in skills](/azure/search/cognitive-search-predefined-skills) based on the Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Language APIs provide AI enrichments such as image optical character recognition (OCR), image analysis, text translation, entity recognition, and full-text search.

1. [Custom skills](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface) support scenarios that require more complex AI models or services. Examples include Azure AI Document Intelligence, Azure Machine Learning models, and Azure Functions.

1. After the enrichment process is complete, the indexer saves the enriched and indexed documents in a [search index](/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index). Full-text search and other query forms can use this index.

1. The enriched documents can also project into a [knowledge store](/azure/search/knowledge-store-concept-intro), which downstream apps like knowledge mining apps or data science apps can use.

1. Queries access the enriched content in the search index. The index supports custom analyzers, fuzzy search queries, filters, and a scoring profile to tune search relevance.

1. Applications that connect to Blob Storage or to Azure Table Storage can access the knowledge store.

### Components

This solution uses the following Azure components.

#### AI Search

[AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-search/) indexes the content and powers the user experience in this solution. You can use AI Search to apply [prebuilt AI skills](/azure/search/cognitive-search-predefined-skills) to content. And you can use the extensibility mechanism to add [custom skills](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface), which provide specific enrichment transformations.

#### Azure AI Vision

[Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-vision) uses [text recognition](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr) to extract and recognize text information from images. The [Read API](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr#ocr-read-editions) uses the latest OCR recognition models and is optimized for large, text-heavy documents and noisy images.

The [legacy OCR API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-2/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499f20d) isn't optimized for large documents but supports more languages. The accuracy of OCR results can vary based on the quality of the scan and the image. This solution uses OCR to produce data in the [hOCR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCR).

#### Language

[Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-language/) uses [text analytics](/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview#available-features) capabilities like [named entity recognition](/azure/synapse-analytics/machine-learning/overview-cognitive-services) and [key phrase extraction](/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-keyphrases) to extract text information from unstructured documents.

#### Azure Storage

[Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/blobs/) is REST-based object storage for data that you can access from anywhere in the world through HTTPS. You can use Blob Storage to expose data publicly to the world or to store application data privately. Blob Storage is ideal for large amounts of unstructured data like text or graphics.

[Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/tables/) stores highly available, scalable, structured, and semi-structured NoSQL data in the cloud.

#### Azure Functions

[Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/functions/) is a serverless compute service that you can use to run small pieces of event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. This solution uses a Functions method to apply the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) cryptonyms list to the JFK Files as a custom skill.

#### Azure App Service

This solution builds a standalone web app in [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service/) to test, demonstrate, and search the index and to explore connections in the enriched and indexed documents.

## Scenario details

Large, unstructured datasets can include typewritten and handwritten notes, photos, diagrams, and other unstructured data that standard search solutions can't parse. The [JFK Files](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/2017-release) contain over 34,000 pages of documents about the CIA investigation of the 1963 JFK assassination.

You can use AI enrichment in AI Search to extract and enhance searchable, indexable text from images, blobs, and other unstructured data sources like the JFK Files. AI enrichment uses pretrained machine learning skill sets from the Azure AI services [Vision](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview) and [Language](/azure/ai-services/language-service/text-analytics-for-health/overview?tabs=ner) APIs. You can also create and attach [custom skills](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface) to add special processing for domain-specific data like CIA cryptonyms. AI Search can then index and search that context.

The AI Search skills in this solution can be categorized into the following groups:

- **Image processing**: This solution uses built-in [text extraction](/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-image-scenarios) and [image analysis](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis?tabs=4-0) skills, including object and face detection, tag and caption generation, and celebrity and landmark identification. These skills create text representations of image content, which you can search by using the query capabilities of AI Search. *Document cracking* is the process of extracting or creating text content from nontext sources.

- **Natural language processing**: This solution uses built-in skills like [entity recognition](/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition), [language detection](/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-language-detection), and [key phrase extraction](/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-keyphrases) that map unstructured text to searchable and filterable fields in an index.

- **Custom skills**: This solution uses custom skills that extend AI Search to apply specific enrichment transformations to content. You can [specify the interface for a custom skill](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface) through the [custom web API skill](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-web-api).

### Potential use cases

The JFK Files [sample project](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureSearch_JFK_Files) and [online demo](https://jfk-demo-2019.azurewebsites.net/#/) presents a particular AI Search use case. This solution idea isn't intended to be a framework or scalable architecture for all scenarios. Instead, this solution idea provides a general guideline and example. The code project and demo create a public website and publicly readable storage container for extracted images, so you shouldn't use this solution with nonpublic data.

You can also use this architecture to:

- Increase the value and utility of unstructured text and image content in search apps and data science apps.

- Use custom skills to integrate open-source code, non-Microsoft code, or Microsoft code into indexing pipelines.

- Make scanned JPG, PNG, or bitmap documents full-text searchable.

- Produce better outcomes than standard PDF text extraction for PDFs with combined image and text. Some scanned and native PDF formats might not parse correctly in AI Search.

- Create new information from inherently meaningful raw content or context that's hidden in large, unstructured documents or semi-structured documents.
