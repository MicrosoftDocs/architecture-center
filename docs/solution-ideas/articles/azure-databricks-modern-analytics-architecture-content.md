Modern data architectures meet these criteria:

- Unify data, analytics, and AI workloads.
- Run efficiently and reliably at any scale.
- Provide insights through analytics dashboards, operational reports, or advanced analytics.

This solution outlines a modern data architecture that achieves these goals. Azure Databricks forms the core of the solution. This platform works seamlessly with other services such as Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. Together, these services provide a solution with these qualities:

- Simple: Unified analytics, data science, and machine learning simplify the data architecture.
- Open: The solution supports open-source code, open standards, and open frameworks. It also works with popular integrated development environments (IDEs), libraries, and programming languages. Through native connectors and APIs, the solution works with a broad range of other services, too.
- Collaborative: Data engineers, data scientists, and analysts work together with this solution. They can use collaborative notebooks, IDEs, dashboards, and other tools to access and analyze common underlying data.

## Potential use cases

The system that Swiss Re Group built for its Property & Casualty Reinsurance division inspired this solution. Besides the insurance industry, any area that works with big data or machine learning can also benefit from this solution. Examples include:

- The energy sector
- Retail and e-commerce
- Banking and finance
- Medicine

   The diagram contains several gray rectangles. Labels on the rectangles read Ingest, Process, Serve, Store, and Monitor and govern. Each rectangle contains icons that represent Azure or partner services. The Azure Databricks icon is at the center, along with the Data Lake Storage icon. Arrows point back and forth between icons. The arrows show how data flows through the system, as the diagram explanation steps describe. The lowest rectangle extends across the bottom of the diagram. It contains icons for services that monitor and govern operations and information.

1. Azure Databricks ingests raw streaming data from Azure Event Hubs.
1. Data Factory loads raw batch data into Data Lake Storage.
1. For data storage:

   - Data Lake Storage houses data of all types, such as structured, unstructured, and semi-structured. It also stores batch and streaming data.
   - Delta Lake forms the curated layer of the data lake. It stores the refined data in an open-source format.
   - Azure Databricks works well with a [medallion architecture][Medallion model] that organizes data into layers:

     - Bronze: Holds raw data.
     - Silver: Contains cleaned, filtered data.
     - Gold: Stores aggregated data that's useful for business analytics.

1. The analytical platform ingests data from the disparate batch and streaming sources. Data scientists use this data for these tasks:

   - Data preparation
   - Data exploration
   - Model preparation
   - Model training

   MLflow manages parameter, metric, and model tracking in data science code runs. The coding possibilities are flexible:

   - Code can be in SQL, Python, R, and Scala.
   - Code can use popular open-source libraries and frameworks such as Koalas, Pandas, and scikit-learn, which are pre-installed and optimized.
   - Practitioners can optimize for performance and cost with single-node and multi-node compute options.

1. Machine learning models are available in several formats:

   - Azure Databricks stores information about models in the [MLflow Model Registry][MLflow Model Registry]. The registry makes models available through batch, streaming, and REST APIs.
   - The solution can also deploy models to Azure Machine Learning web services or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

1. Services that work with the data connect to a single underlying data source to ensure consistency. For instance, users can run SQL queries on the data lake with Azure Databricks SQL Analytics. This service:

   - Provides a query editor and catalog, the query history, basic dashboarding, and alerting.
   - Uses integrated security that includes row-level and column-level permissions.
   - Uses a [Photon-powered Delta Engine to accelerate performance][Photon improves performance].

1. Power BI generates analytical and historical reports and dashboards from the unified data platform. When working with Azure Databricks, this service uses these features:

   - A [built-in Azure Databricks connector][Power BI connector for Azure Databricks] for visualizing the underlying data.
   - Optimized Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers.

1. Users can export gold data sets out of the data lake into Azure Synapse via the optimized Synapse connector. SQL pools in Azure Synapse provide a data warehousing and compute environment.

1. The solution uses Azure services for collaboration, performance, reliability, governance, and security:

   - Azure Purview provides data discovery services, sensitive data classification, and governance insights across the data estate.
   - Azure DevOps offers continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) and other integrated version control features.
   - Azure Key Vault securely manages secrets, keys, and certificates.
   - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides single sign-on (SSO) for Azure Databricks users. Azure Databricks supports automated user provisioning with Azure AD for these tasks:

     - Creating new users.
     - Assigning each user an access level.
     - Removing users and denying them access.

   - Azure Monitor collects and analyzes Azure resource telemetry. By proactively identifying problems, this service maximizes performance and reliability.
   - Azure Cost Management and Billing provides financial governance services for Azure workloads.
