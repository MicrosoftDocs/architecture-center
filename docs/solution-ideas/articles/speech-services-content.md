With Speech Services, it's easy to transcribe every call. Index the transcription for [full-text search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search), or apply [Text Analytics](/azure/cognitive-services/Text-Analytics) to detect sentiment, language, and key phrases for insights. If your call center recordings involve specialized terminology, such as product names or IT jargon, create a custom [language model](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-customize-language-model) to teach Speech Services the vocabulary. A custom [acoustic model](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-customize-acoustic-models) helps Speech Services understand speakers even with background noise or poor phone connections.
