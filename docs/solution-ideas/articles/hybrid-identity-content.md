The need to keep application components on-premises doesn't have to be a barrier to adopting cloud technologies. With Azure Stack Hub, app components can reside on-premises while interacting with components running in Azure public cloud. This blueprint enables teams to manage identity for users as well as applications in a way that is consistent across clouds.
