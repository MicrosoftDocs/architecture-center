# Remote Patient Monitoring Solutions

[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

Predict and prevent future incidents by combining IoT and intelligence to optimize treatments, using Azure to remotely monitor patients and analyze the massive amounts of data generated by medical devices.

## Architecture

*Download an [SVG](../media/remote-patient-monitoring.svg) of this architecture.*

## Data Flow

1. Securely ingest medical sensor and device data using Azure IoT Hub.
1. Securely store sensor and device data in Cosmos DB.
1. Analyze sensor and device data using a pre-trained Cognitive Services API or a custom developed Machine Learning model.
1. Store Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning results in Cosmos DB.
1. Interact AI and Machine Learning results using Power BI, while preserving Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
1. Integrate data insights with backend systems and processes using Logic Apps.
