This solution idea shows how to deploy an e-commerce web site on Azure. The e-commerce web site is hosted on Azure Web App and uses Azure Cosmos DB as data store for  product information and session state. Azure Search provides search functionality over diverse product catalogs, traffic spikes, and rapidly changing inventory.

## Architecture

*Download an [SVG](../media/retail-and-e-commerce-using-cosmos-db.svg) of this architecture.*

## Components

This architecture includes the following components:

* [Azure Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web) is used to host the e-commerce web application.
* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db) stores the products and the session state.
* [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage): Static product images and other static contents are stored in an Azure Storage account.
* [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search) provides a search capability over all the products.
