Transform your data into actionable insights using the best-in-class machine learning tools. This solution allows you to combine any data at any scale, and to build and deploy custom machine learning models at scale.

## Potential use cases

Organizations have the ability to access more data than ever before. Advanced analytics help take advantage of data insights. Areas include:

* Customer service.
* Predictive maintenance.
* Recommending products or services.
* System optimization of everything from supply chains to data center operations.
* Product and services development.

### Dataflow

1. Bring together all your structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data (logs, files, and media) using Synapse Pipelines to Azure Data Lake Storage.
1. Use Apache Spark pools to clean and transform the structureless datasets and combine them with structured data from operational databases or data warehouses.
1. Use scalable machine learning/deep learning techniques, to derive deeper insights from this data using Python, Scala, or .NET, with notebook experiences in Apache Spark pool.
1. Apply  Apache Spark pool and Synapse Pipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics to access and move data at scale.
1. Query and report on data in [Power BI](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-connect-pbi).
1. Take the insights from Apache Spark pools to Cosmos DB to make them accessible through web and mobile apps.

### Workflow
