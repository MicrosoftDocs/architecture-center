## Data Flow

1. Bring together all your structured, unstructured and semi-structured data (logs, files, and media) using Synapse Pipelines to Azure Data Lake Storage.
1. Use Apache Spark pools to clean and transform the structureless datasets and combine them with structured data from operational databases or data warehouses.
1. Use scalable machine learning/deep learning techniques, to derive deeper insights from this data using Python, Scala or .NET, with notebook experiences in Apache Spark pool.
1. Leverage  Apache Spark pool and Synapse Pipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics to access and move data at scale.
1. Query and report on data in [Power BI](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-connect-pbi).
1. Take the insights from Apache Spark pools to Cosmos DB to make them accessible through web and mobile apps.
