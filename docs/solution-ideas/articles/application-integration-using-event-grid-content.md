Event Grid connects your app with other services. For example, create an application topic to send your app's event data to Event Grid and take advantage of its reliable delivery, advanced routing, and direct integration with Azure. Alternatively, you can use Event Grid with Logic Apps to process data anywhere, without writing code.

## Data Flow

1. Bring together all your structured, unstructured and semi-structured data (logs, files, and media) using Azure Data Factory to Azure Data Lake Storage.
1. Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform the structureless datasets and combine them with structured data from operational databases or data warehouses.
1. Use scalable machine learning/deep learning techniques, to derive deeper insights from this data using Python, R or Scala, with inbuilt notebook experiences in Azure Databricks.
1. Leverage native connectors between Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics to access and move data at scale.
1. Power users take advantage of the inbuilt capabilities of Azure Databricks to perform root cause determination and raw data analysis.
1. Query and report on data in [Power BI](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-connect-pbi).
1. Take the insights from Azure Databricks to Cosmos DB to make them accessible through web and mobile apps.
