Learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to predict failures before they happen with real-time assembly line data.

This solution is built on Azure-managed services: [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics), [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs), [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning), [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics), and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Potential use cases

Industries that benefit from this solution include:

- Manufacturing processes
- Airline maintenance scheduling

### Components

* [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs) ingests raw assembly-line data and passes it on to Azure Stream Analytics.
* [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics) provides near real-time analytics on the input stream from Event Hubs. Input data is filtered and passed to an Azure Machine Learning endpoint. Results of machine learning are sent to a Power BI dashboard.
* [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning) predicts potential failures based on real-time assembly-line data from Stream Analytics.
* [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/synapse-analytics) stores assembly-line data along with failure predictions.
* [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) enables visualization of real-time assembly-line data from Stream Analytics, and the predicted failures and alerts from Data Warehouse.
