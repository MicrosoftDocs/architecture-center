# Forecast Energy and Power Demand

[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

Learn how Microsoft Azure can help accurately forecast spikes in demand for energy products and services to give your company a competitive advantage.

This solution is built on the Azure managed services: [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics), [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs), [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning), [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database), [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). These services run in a high-availability environment, patched and supported, allowing you to focus on your solution instead of the environment they run in.

## Components

* [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics): Stream Analytics aggregates energy consumption data in near real-time to write to Power BI.
* [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs) ingests raw energy consumption data and passes it on to Stream Analytics.
* [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning): Machine Learning forecasts the energy demand of a particular region given the inputs received.
* [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database): SQL Database stores the prediction results received from Azure Machine Learning. These results are then consumed in the Power BI dashboard.
* [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory) handles orchestration and scheduling of the hourly model retraining.
* [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) visualizes energy consumption data from Stream Analytics as well as predicted energy demand from SQL Database.
