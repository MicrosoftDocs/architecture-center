Environmental monitoring has become an important activity in the global supply chain. It provides key signals that help drive real-time decisions that can impact suppliers and logistics. Air quality, temperature, wind, humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) are some of the indicators that warehouse operators are interested in monitoring during natural disasters. More advanced scenarios can include the fusion of real-time and historical data from weather stations, air quality sensors, and other sources. Machine learning (ML) models can then be used to help predict the effect of these conditions and their possible impact on supply chain operations.

This article describes a warehouse management scenario that monitors environmental conditions through the integration of sensor data and public datasets, processed with ML to generate predictions. The insights are then used to ensure the safety of people and optimize supply chain operations.

## Potential use cases

- **Fleet management:** This solution can be used where routes need to be optimized for safety based on the evolving conditions of surrounding areas.
- **Agriculture:** Predicting wildfires that will impact the safety of workers and livestock is critical. By providing ample lead time for danger notifications, people in the affected area can evacuate to safety. Farms can also equip livestock areas with automated gates that can unlock and open in dire situations, allowing animals to escape.

### Challenges faced

There has been a significant [increase in wildfires](https://news.sciencebrief.org/wildfires-sep2020-update/) in recent years, posing a growing danger to humans and the global supply chain. With the number of acres burned increasing by the year, [supply chain resilience to climate change](https://www.thebci.org/uploads/assets/e02a3e5f-82e5-4ff1-b8bc61de9657e9c8/BCI-0007h-Supply-Chain-Resilience-ReportLow-Singles.pdf) is top of mind for many leaders.

In the United States, the annual average of area affected by wildfires is approximately 7,000,000 acres. This is more than double the average during the 1990s. The situation is even more alarming in other countries. For example, in Australia there is an extra month of summer compared to 50 years ago and long-term drought has further worsened fire conditions. Massive bushfires there have caused economic damage nearly 10 times greater than in the United States. Australian wildfires can [impact the global food supply](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/australian-wildfires-global-food-supply), including goods like beef, milk, wine, and wheat.

Risks to businesses worldwide [continue to increase each year](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/supply-chain-resilience-era-climate-change), and supply chain resiliency during natural disasters is critical to maintaining the flow of goods globally. [Integrating weather-based forecasts and predictions](https://lot.dhl.com/if-australias-bushfires-are-the-new-normal-how-should-companies-manage-risks/) into supply chain capacity planning can help operators adjust production and manage shipping schedules. This system can minimize disruptions and adverse effects.

### Business outcomes

Warehouse operators and major distribution centers will benefit from a predictive way to determine if existing logistics infrastructure is in the path of a major fire. Having an early notification system would provide increased lead time to take preventive measures to protect facilities and personnel. Automated notices of changes and pauses in logistics activities would also allow rerouting of shipments with minimal human intervention.

### Requirements

- Automation is critical. It can't be assumed that operators and facility managers can gather data across multiple systems to make timely decisions.
- Warehouses, distribution facilities, and operation managers need to be notified by multiple means when there is immediate danger, ensuring the information is received in a timely fashion. Examples include data dashboard, email, and text message.
- Only changes in the data need to be reported.
- The delivery and deployment of the solution needs to be simple. It should be installed without the need of a technician, using plug and play technology.
- The solution needs to be low maintenance and cost effective.

### Patterns to address challenges

The table below provides a summary of common use cases and corresponding IoT solutions. Each use case is an example of how an IoT process pattern can be applied to real-world scenarios.

| Use case | Solutions | Pattern
|---|---|---|
| Enable supply chain logistics rerouting and production planning by predicting likelihood of interruption due to wildfires near the impacted location. | Ideally, you want to be able to monitor all the key elements of the supply chain so that you can provide a more comprehensive response. [myDevices](https://mydevices.com/) has a catalog of certified plug and play devices that connect to a [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) network gateway. The gateway sends data to the cloud application using cellular connectivity. LoRa technology is ideal because the signal needs to penetrate deep into the buildings. Sensors for CO2, temperature, humidity, wind direction, and air quality can be installed in relevant building locations including roofs and storage facilities. Sensors can also be installed in trucks for location tracking to facilitate rerouting. | [Analyze and optimize](../../example-scenario/iot/analyze-optimize-loop.yml) |
| Identify wildfire conditions and understand the degree of danger for a given location. | Wildfire prediction models trained with historical data, micro-weather conditions, and local sensor data can help assess the risk of a wildfire. | [Analyze and optimize](../../example-scenario/iot/analyze-optimize-loop.yml) |
| Automated alerts for evacuation and facility rerouting | Once unsafe conditions are detected, the digital twin of the facility can then be updated to show that it's no longer online. Once updated, other distribution centers within the network can begin to reroute traffic accordingly, allowing on-site facility managers and warehouse operators to focus on employee safety. This scenario uses ML to predict where the wildfire will spread, using public real-time and historical data sets along with micro weather data for more accurate predictions. Sensors track current wildfire conditions, and facility alarms trigger employee evacuation. | [Analyze and optimize](../../example-scenario/iot/analyze-optimize-loop.yml) |

## Considerations

### Connectivity

The solution's on-site devices and sensors need to send data to applications in the cloud, but reliable internet access may not be available for some locations, such as in rural areas.

This solution uses a LoRa network to provide cellular connectivity. LoRa has good building penetration, making it ideal for warehouse-related applications. This approach is cost-effective and provides flexibility for remote locations that require easy-to-connect IoT devices and sensors.

### Plug and play

In a remote setting, it's critical that devices are easy to deploy without requiring specialized expertise. myDevices has an extensive catalog of IoT devices and gateways that can be applied to multiple scenarios. They are Plug and Play certified, so all the user needs to do is place them in the right location and turn them on. With their IoT Central integration, customers can easily customize their dashboard to consume their device data and create alerts.
