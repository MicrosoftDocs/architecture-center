Rapidly build engaging, performant, and scalable cross-platform and native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac.

## Potential use cases

This solution is for any organization that utilizes both web and mobile applications.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram shows browser or mobile app requests to Azure App Services to Azure Database for My S Q L.](../media/scalable-web-and-mobile-applications-using-azure-database-for-mysql.png)
_Download an [SVG](../media/scalable-web-and-mobile-applications-using-azure-database-for-mysql.svg) of this architecture._

### Dataflow

1. A browser or mobile app makes requests for resources from the API.
1. The requests are transmitted using HTTPS with [TLS termination](/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate), which is handled by Azure App Services.
1. Azure App Services handles API requests, and it can be [scaled up](/azure/app-service/manage-scale-up) or [scaled out](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started) to handle the changing demand.
1. Azure Database for MySQL provides a relational database service that's powered by the MySQL community edition. Use the [flexible server](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview) deployment mode to enable scaling your database within seconds.
