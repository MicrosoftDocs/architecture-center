1. The customer information is recorded in [Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/) or other CRM.
1. The information about a new customer is sent to [Power BI](/power-bi/).
1. The customer information is added to the mailing list ([MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/)).
1. The solution creates a record of the member in [Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/).
