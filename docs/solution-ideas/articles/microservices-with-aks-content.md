> Microservices with AKS and Azure DevOps is a variant of [Design a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps](../../example-scenario/apps/devops-dotnet-baseline.yml). This article focuses on the AKS-specific facets of deployment.

## Potential use cases

Use AKS to simplify the deployment and management of microservices-based architecture. AKS streamlines horizontal scaling, self-healing, load balancing, and secret management.

## Architecture

:::image type="complex" source="../media/microservices-with-aks.svg" lightbox="../media/microservices-with-aks.svg" alt-text="Architecture diagram of an AKS CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines." border="false"::: 
Architecture diagram of an Azure pipeline. The diagram shows the following steps: 1. An engineer pushing code changes to an Azure DevOps Git repository. 2. An Azure DevOps PR pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: linting, restore, build, and unit tests. 3. An Azure DevOps CI pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: get secrets, linting, restore, build, unit tests, integration tests, publishing build artifacts and publishing container image. 3. A container image being published to a non-production Azure Container Registry. 4. An Azure DevOps CD pipeline getting triggered. This pipeline shows the following tasks: deploy to staging, acceptance tests, promote container image, manual intervention, and release. 5. Shows the CD pipeline deploying to a staging environment. 6. Shows the container image being promoted to the production Azure Container Registry. 7 Shows the CD pipeline releasing to a production environment. 8. Shows Container Insights forwarding telemetry to Azure Monitor. 9. Shows an operator monitoring the pipeline, taking advantage of Azure Monitor, Azure Application Insights and Azure Analytics Workspace.

### Dataflow

1. A pull request (PR) to Azure Repos Git triggers a PR pipeline. This pipeline runs fast quality checks such as linting, building, and unit testing the code. If any of the checks fail, the PR doesn't merge. The result of a successful run of this pipeline is a successful merge of the PR.
2. A merge to Azure Repos Git triggers a CI pipeline. This pipeline runs the same tasks as the PR pipeline with some important additions. The CI pipeline runs integration tests. These tests require secrets, so this pipeline gets those secrets from Azure Key Vault.
3. The result of a successful run of this pipeline is the creation and publishing of a container image in a non-production Azure Container Repository.
4. The completion of the CI pipeline [triggers the CD pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/pipeline-triggers).
5. The CD pipeline deploys a YAML template to the staging AKS environment. The template specifies the container image from the non-production environment. The pipeline then performs acceptance tests against the staging environment to validate the deployment. If the tests succeed, a manual validation task is run, requiring a person to validate the deployment and resume the pipeline. The manual validation step is optional. Some organizations will automatically deploy.
6. If the manual intervention is resumed, the CD pipeline promotes the image from the non-production Azure Container Registry to the production registry.
7. The CD pipeline deploys a YAML template to the production AKS environment. The template specifies the container image from the production environment.
8. Container Insights forwards performance metrics, inventory data, and health state information from container hosts and containers to Azure Monitor every 3 minutes.
9. Azure Monitor collects observability data such as logs and metrics so that an operator can analyze health, performance, and usage data. Application Insights collects all application-specific monitoring data, such as traces. Azure Log Analytics is used to store all that data.

### Components

- [Container Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) collects logs and metrics and logs and forwards them to Azure Monitor.
- [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) is a managed, private container registry service on Azure. Use Container Registry to store private container images.
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry) is a managed Kubernetes service where Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance.
