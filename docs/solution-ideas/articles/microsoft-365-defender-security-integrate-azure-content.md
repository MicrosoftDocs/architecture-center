You can enhance the security posture of your organization’s IT environment by using the security features of both Microsoft 365 and Azure. This article, the fifth in a series of five, describes how you can integrate the security features of these services by using Microsoft 365 Defender and Azure monitoring services. 

This article builds on the previous articles in the series:

1. [Use Azure monitoring to integrate security components](../../guide/security/azure-monitor-integrate-security-components.yml) provides an overall view of how you can integrate the security services of Azure and Microsoft 365 Defender.

2. [Map threats to your IT environment](./map-threats-it-environment.yml) describes methods to map examples of common threats, tactics, and techniques against an example of a hybrid IT environment that uses both on-premises and Microsoft cloud services.

3. [Build the first layer of defense with Azure Security services](./azure-security-build-first-layer-defense.yml) maps an example of some Azure security services that create the first layer of defense to protect your Azure environment according to Azure Security Benchmark version 3.

4. [Build the second layer of defense with Microsoft 365 Defender Security services](./microsoft-365-defender-build-second-layer-defense.yml) describes an example of a series of attacks against your IT environment and how to add another layer of protection by using Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Architecture

This diagram shows a complete architecture reference. It includes an example of an IT environment, a set of example threats that are described according to their tactics (in blue), and their techniques (in the text box) according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. The MITRE ATT&CK matrix is covered in [Map threats to your IT environment](./map-threats-it-environment.yml). 

There are important services that are presented in the diagram. Some of those services, such as Network Watcher and Application Insights, are focused on capturing information from specific services. Some of them, like Log Analytics (also known as Azure Monitor Logs) and Microsoft Sentinel, are core services because they can collect, store, and analyze information from various services, regardless of whether they're network, compute, or applications services.

The central part of the diagram has two layers of security services. There's also one layer with specific Azure monitoring services that are integrated through Azure Monitor (on the left side of the diagram). The key component of this integration is Microsoft Sentinel.

The diagram shows the following services in **Core Monitoring Services** and in the **Monitor** layer:

- Azure Monitor
- Log Analytics
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Network Watcher
- Traffic Analytics (part of Network Watcher)
- Application Insights
- Storage Analytics

### Workflow

1.  **Azure Monitor** is the umbrella for many Azure monitoring services. It includes log management, metrics, and Application Insights, among others. It also provides a collection of dashboards that are ready for use and management of alerts. For more information, see [Azure Monitor overview](/azure/azure-monitor/overview).

2.  **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** delivers recommendations for virtual machines (VMs), storage, applications, and other resources, that help an IT environment to be compliant with various regulatory standards, such as ISO and PCI. At the same time, Defender for Cloud offers a score for the security posture of systems that can help you track the security of your environment. Defender for Cloud also offers automatic alerts that are based on the logs that it collects and analyzes. Defender for Cloud was formerly known as Azure Security Center. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction).

3.  **Log Analytics** is one of the most important services. It's responsible for storing all the logs and alerts that are used to create alerts, insights, and incidents. Microsoft Sentinel works on top of Log Analytics. Basically, all data that Log Analytics ingests is available automatically to Microsoft Sentinel. Log Analytics is also known as Azure Monitor Logs. For more information, see [Overview of Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview).

4.  **Microsoft Sentinel** works like a façade for Log Analytics. While Log Analytics stores logs and alerts from various sources, Microsoft Sentinel offers APIs that help with ingestion of logs from various sources. Those sources include on-premises VMs, Azure VMs, alerts from Microsoft 365 Defender and other services. Microsoft Sentinel correlates the logs to provide insights about what is going on in your IT environment, avoiding false positives. Microsoft Sentinel is the core of security and monitoring for Microsoft cloud services. For more information about Microsoft Sentinel, see [What is Microsoft Sentinel?](/azure/sentinel/overview).

The preceding services in this list are core services that work throughout Azure, Office 365, and on-premises environments. The following services focus on specific resources:

5.  **Network Watcher** provides tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for resources in an Azure virtual network. For more information, see [What is Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview)?

6.  **Traffic Analytics** is part of Network Watcher and works on top of logs from network security groups (NSGs). Traffic Analytics offers many dashboards that are capable of aggregating metrics from outbound and inbound connection in Azure Virtual Network. For more information, see [Traffic Analytics](/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics).

7.  **Application Insights** focuses on applications and provides extensible performance management and monitoring for live web apps, including support for a wide variety of platform such as .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python. Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor. For more information, see [Application Insights overview](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

8.  **Azure Storage Analytics** performs logging and provides metrics for a storage account. You can use its data to trace requests, analyze usage trends, and diagnose issues with your storage account. For more information, see [Use Azure Storage analytics to collect logs and metrics data](/azure/storage/common/storage-analytics).

9.  Because this architecture reference is based on [Microsoft Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/), the services and components under **Infrastructure and Endpoint** don't have specific monitoring services. Azure Monitor logs and Defender for Cloud are the main services that collect, store, and analyze logs from VMs and others compute services.

The key component in this architecture is Microsoft Sentinel, because it connects all the logs and alerts that are provided by Azure security services, Microsoft 365 Defender, and Azure Monitor. After you implement Microsoft Sentinel and it's receiving logs and alerts from all the sources that are identified in this article, the next step is to map a set of queries of those logs to obtain insights and evidence of indicators of compromise (IOCs). When information is captured by Microsoft Sentinel, you can investigate it or allow an automated response that you configure to mitigate or resolve the incident. Automatic responses include actions like blocking a user on in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or blocking an IP address via the firewall.

For more information about Microsoft Sentinel, see [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](/azure/sentinel).

### How to access security and monitoring services

The following list provides information about how to access each of the services that are presented in this article:

- **Azure security services**. You can access all the Azure security services that are mentioned in the diagrams in this series of articles by using [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the portal, use the search function to locate the services that you're interested in and access them.

- **Azure Monitor**. Azure Monitor is available in all Azure subscriptions. You can access it from a search for *monitor* in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

- **Defender for Cloud**. Defender for Cloud is available to anyone who accesses the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the portal, search for *Defender for Cloud*.

- **Log Analytics**. To access Log Analytics, you must first create the service in the portal, because it doesn't exist by default. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for *Log Analytics workspace*, and then select **Create**. After creation, you're able to access the service.

- **Microsoft Sentinel**. Because Microsoft Sentinel works on top of Log Analytics, you must first create a Log Analytics workspace. Next, search for *sentinel* in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then create the service by choosing the workspace that you want to have behind Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. Defender for Endpoint is part of Microsoft 365 Defender. Access the service through [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com). This is a change from the previous URL, *securitycenter.windows.com*.

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**. Defender for Cloud Apps is part of Microsoft 365. Access the service through [https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com).

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**. Defender for Office 365 is part of Microsoft 365. Access the service through [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), the same portal used for Defender for Endpoint. (This is a change from the previous URL, *protection.office.com*.)

- **Microsoft Defender for Identity**. Defender for Identity is part of Microsoft 365. You access the service through [https://portal.atp.azure.com](https://portal.atp.azure.com). Although it's a cloud service, Defender for Identity is responsible for also protecting identity on on-premises systems.

- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**. Endpoint Manager is the new name for Intune, Configuration Manager, and other services. Access it through [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com). To learn more about accessing the services that are provided by Microsoft 365 Defender and how each portal is related, see [Build the second layer of defense with Microsoft 365 Defender Security services](./microsoft-365-defender-build-second-layer-defense.yml).

- **Azure Network Watcher**. To access Azure Network Watcher, search for *watcher* in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

- **Traffic Analytics**. Traffic Analytics is part of Network Watcher. You can access it from the menu on the left side in Network Watcher. It's a powerful network monitor that works based on your NSGs that are implemented on your individual network interfaces and subnets. Network Watcher requires collection of information from the NSGs. For instructions on how to collect that information, see [Tutorial: Log network traffic to and from a virtual machine using the Azure portal](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal).

- **Application Insight**. Application Insight is part of Azure Monitor. However, you must first create it for the application that you want to monitor. For some applications built on Azure, such as Web Apps, you can create Application Insight directly from the provisioning of Web Apps. To access it, search for *monitor* in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). In the **Monitor** page, select **Applications** in the menu on the left side.

- **Storage Analytics**. Azure Storage offers various types of storage under the same storage account technology. You can find blobs, files, tables, and queues on top of storage accounts. Storage analytics offers a broad range of metrics to use with those storage services. Access Storage Analytics from your Storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then select **Diagnostic settings** in the menu on the left side. Choose one log analytics workspace to send that information. Then you can access a dashboard from **Insights**. Everything in your storage account that's being monitored is represented in the menu.

### Components

The example architecture in this article uses the following Azure components:

- [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD helps your users to access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. It also helps them access internal resources, like apps on your corporate intranet network.

All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.

- [Azure SQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql/database) is a fully managed PaaS database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring. It provides these functions without user involvement. SQL Database provides a range of built-in security and compliance features to help your application meet security and compliance requirements.

## Solution details

Monitoring solutions on Azure might seem confusing at first, because Azure offers multiple monitoring services. However, each Azure monitoring service is important in the security and monitoring strategy that's described in this series. The articles in this series describe the various services and how to plan effective security for your IT environment.
1. [Use Azure monitoring to integrate security components](../../guide/security/azure-monitor-integrate-security-components.yml)
2. [Map threats to your IT environment](./map-threats-it-environment.yml)
3. [Build the first layer of defense with Azure Security services](./azure-security-build-first-layer-defense.yml)
4. [Build the second layer of defense with Microsoft 365 Defender Security services](./microsoft-365-defender-build-second-layer-defense.yml)

### Potential use cases

This reference architecture can help you understand the whole picture of Microsoft Cloud security services and to how to integrate them for the best security posture.

You don't need to implement all the security services that are presented in this architecture. However, this example and the threat map that's represented in the architecture diagram can help you to understand how to create your own map and then plan accordingly for your security strategy. Select the right Azure security services and the Microsoft 365 Defender services that you want to integrate through Azure so that your IT environment has the security that it needs.

## Cost optimization

Pricing for the Azure services that are presented in this series of articles is calculated in various ways. Some services are free of charge, some have a charge for each use, and some have a charge that is based on licensing. The best way to estimate the pricing for any of the Azure security services is to use the [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator). In the calculator, search for a service that you're interested in, and then select it to get all the variables that determine the price for the service.

Microsoft 365 Defender security services work with licenses. For information about the licensing requirements, see [Microsoft 365 Defender prerequisites](/microsoft-365/security/defender/prerequisites?view=o365-worldwide).
