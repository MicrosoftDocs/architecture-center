To address business transformations like acquisitions or divestitures, teams need to plan for the separation or joining of their cloud workloads from an existing Microsoft Entra tenant to a new tenant. This article describes how to define and implement a cross-tenant workload migration strategy.

## Architecture

:::image type="complex" border="false" source="../media/cross-tenant-migration-strategy.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a cross-tenant migration architecture." lightbox="../media/cross-tenant-migration-strategy.svg":::
   This diagram outlines a resource migration process. First the Azure Resource Manager template and configuration files are extracted and stored in a source code repository or configuration repository. Then those files are deployed to target resource groups in a new tenant. A temporary subscription, known as a sidecar subscription, is created in the original tenant to hold backups and cloned data service resources. Resources are then cloned by using tools like Azure Data Factory or AzCopy. After the resources are cloned, the subscription is moved to the new tenant. Finally, the resources are migrated or restored in their target groups before the temporary subscription is deleted.

### Dataflow

The following dataflow corresponds to the previous diagram:

1. Prepare the infrastructure and configuration artifacts:

   1. Extract the Azure Resource Manager template and configuration artifacts and store them in a source code repository or configuration repository. This step conforms with infrastructure as code practices and helps ensure that the migrated resources have the same resource deployment definition. It also facilitates deployment automation.

   1. Deploy both the infrastructure and configuration artifacts to the target resource group or groups in the new tenant subscription.

1. Create a sidecar subscription in the existing tenant to host cloned data service resources and backups of virtual machines (VMs). Most organizations have a cloud platform team or subscription vending process that can create this subscription.

1. Clone the resources by using a tool like Azure Data Factory, AzCopy for data migration, or native backup and restore capabilities.

1. Move the subscription to the new tenant.

1. Either move the resources to the target resource group or migrate data to the pre-created resources in the target resource group. Alternatively, restore VMs from the backups. Your implementation plan should describe the provisioning method.

1. Delete the sidecar subscription.

### Components

- [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Your Microsoft Entra tenant represents your organization and helps you manage an instance of cloud services for your internal and external guests.

- An [Azure subscription](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/fundamental-concepts) is a logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with only one subscription. Creating a subscription is the first step in Azure adoption.

- [Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops) provides developer services that can help your teams plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications.

- [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview) provides cost-effective solutions for backing up your data and recovering it from Azure.

- [Azure App Service](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/app-service-web-apps) is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It provides [continuous deployment](/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment) and other DevOps capabilities.

- [Azure SQL Database](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-sql-database-well-architected-framework) is a fully managed and intelligent relational database service that's built for the cloud. You can use SQL Database to create a high-performance data storage layer for modern cloud applications.

- The [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) platform is the Microsoft cloud solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage provides highly available, massively scalable, and durable storage for various data objects in the cloud.

- [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is) is an enterprise analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems.

- [Azure Machine Learning](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-machine-learning) is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows.

- [Azure Databricks](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-databricks-security) provides a unified set of tools that you can use to build, deploy, share, and maintain enterprise-grade data solutions at scale.

- [Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) is a set of cloud-based AI services that can help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications, even if they don't have AI or data science skills or knowledge.

- [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/cosmos-db) is a fully managed NoSQL and relational database for modern app development.

- [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/event-hubs) is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.

- [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is a cloud service that you can use to provide access to secrets and store them with enhanced security.

- [Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/virtual-machines) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure provides. You typically use a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than other choices provide.

- [Resource groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli) are logical containers for Azure resources. This architecture uses resource groups to organize all resources.

## Scenario details

To address business transformations like acquisitions or divesture, the transitioning workload team, including developers, architects, operations, and technical decision makers, needs to plan for the separation and joining of their cloud workloads from an existing Microsoft Entra tenant to a new Microsoft Entra tenant. This planning can help ensure that all data and application services are reliably migrated, secured, and isolated to their respective business boundaries.

If your workload exists in a single subscription, in many cases you can use the built-in subscription-move feature to transfer the entire subscription to a new Microsoft Entra tenant. However, because most divestiture organization workloads are intertwined with retaining organization workloads before the split, achieving migration readiness requires a different approach.

In this scenario, a healthcare company that has multiple global business units wants to divest a business. To divest, they need to define and implement a cross-directory workload migration strategy.

To begin, the company classifies workload resources into three categories. One group includes compute resources managed by using PaaS. A second group includes data services that require both PaaS and IaaS support. The final group includes compute resources managed by using IaaS. For each resource type, they use the following approaches.

- For PaaS, or compute, resources that run based on logic and configuration, recreate these resources in the target tenant. Use DevOps processes.

  PaaS compute resources include Key Vault, Machine Learning, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Databricks.

- For PaaS and IaaS, or data service, resources that store data, relocate Azure subscriptions from one Microsoft Entra tenant to another. Move these resources to the new tenant via a sidecar subscription. You need to carefully evaluate the resources before you move them. For example, an Azure SQL database with Microsoft Entra authentication integration enabled can't be moved in its existing state. Use backup and restore instead. This process removes all role-based access control (RBAC) assignments. After the resource is moved to the new tenant, you need to restore those RBAC assignments.

  PaaS and IaaS data include services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Azure Cosmos DB.

- For IaaS, or compute, resources that provide hosting for customized logic, create backups and restore the resources in the target environment.

  IaaS compute include resources like Virtual Machines hosting applications or databases.

### Potential use cases

- Organizational divestiture and acquisition
- Internal organization spin-offs
- Investing natively in Azure and moving away from a service provider model
