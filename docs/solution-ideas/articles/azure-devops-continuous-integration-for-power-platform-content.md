### Dataflow

1. The solution is updated, which triggers the build pipeline.
1. Continuous integration exports the solution from the development environment and commits files to Azure Repos.
1. Continuous integration builds a managed solution, runs tests, and creates a build artifact.
1. You deploy to your build/test environment.
1. Continuous deployment runs tests and orchestrates the deployment of the managed solution to the target environments.
1. You deploy to the production environment.
1. Application Insights collects and analyzes health, performance, and usage data.
1. You review the health, performance, and usage information.
1. You update your backlog item(s), as required.
