## Data Flow

1. Customer submits feedback posted to a web endpoint.
1. The feedback is posted to Microsoft Cognitive Services Text Analytics API to extract sentiment and keywords.
1. The customer feedback creates a new case in Dynamics CRM or other CRM.
1. The solution sends a text message to the customer, thanking them for the feedback.
1. If the feedback sentiment scores lower than 0.3, the app posts this information to a customer service channel to respond.
