This article outlines a three-tier application for securely storing data and providing high-value analytics over aggregated data. The architecture takes advantage of Azure built-in security and high-performance features.

## Architecture

### Dataflow

The architecture shows the flow of data in a common three-tier application design:

- A client interacts with the application's presentation tierâ€”a mobile app or a web app in a browser.
- Azure App Service hosts back-end APIs and business logic in the application tier. These components process and aggregate the financial data.
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL stores the financial data in the data tier.
- Power BI ingests data for analytics.

### Components

- [App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service) enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/postgresql) is a relational database service that's powered by the PostgreSQL community edition.
- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

## Scenario details

This solution is a basic example of a three-tier application on Azure:

- The presentation tier consists of a web app or browser and a mobile app.
- In the application tier, App Service provides the logic and computing power for the application.
- In the data tier, Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers a fully managed OSS database.

Power BI, which supports native connectivity with PostgreSQL, provides data analytics in this solution.

### Potential use cases

You can use this solution to manage financial data. The architecture also applies to various other use cases, including retail, education, and travel scenarios.
