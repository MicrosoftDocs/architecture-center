This serverless architecture enables you to build and run applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and the associated management and maintenance. By using it, you can dramatically improve developer productivity.

## Potential use cases

This scenario is for organizations that have customers, and it's ideal for the retail and media and entertainment industries. 

- Service based subscriptions (streaming videos, applications such as Office 365 and Adobe, etc.)

## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. Information about the new customer is posted to a web endpoint.
1. The customer's photo is posted to [Cognitive Services Face API](/azure/cognitive-services/face). Face API associates the customer's photo and name.
1. The customer information is recorded in [Dynamics 365](/dynamics365) or other CRM.
1. The information about a new customer is sent to [Power BI](/power-bi).
1. The customer information is added to the mailing list ([MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com)).
1. The solution creates a record of the member in [Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db).
