## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. The user uses the application, which is hosted on [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/), either via web browser or mobile device
1. Azure App Service communicates with [Azure Bot Service](/azure/bot-service/) in order to facilitate the user/application interaction
1. Azure Bot Service leverages [Azure Cognitive Services Language Understanding](/azure/cognitive-services/luis/what-is-luis) in order to understand the user natural by identifying user intents and entities
1. Language Understanding (LUIS) returns back to the Azure Bot the identified user intent based on conversation made
1. Azure Bot passes a kind of visual context input (e.g image) to the [Azure Bing Visual Search API](/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search)
1. Visual Search returns output back to Azure Bot Service
1. Optionally, the Azure Bot receives more information for user queries exclusively from the user's domain using the [Azure Custom Search API](/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search)
1. Custom Search API returns output back to Bot Service
