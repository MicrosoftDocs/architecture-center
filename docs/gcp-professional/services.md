# GCP to Azure services comparison

This article helps you understand how Microsoft Azure services compare to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Whether you are planning a multi-cloud solution with Azure and GCP, or migrating to Azure, you can compare the IT capabilities of Azure and GCP services in all categories.

This article compares services that are roughly comparable. Not every GCP service or Azure service is listed, and not every matched service has exact feature-for-feature parity.
