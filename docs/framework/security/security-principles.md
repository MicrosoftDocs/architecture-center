# Security design principles


These principles support these three key strategies and describe a securely
architected system hosted on cloud or on-premises datacenters (or a combination
of both). Application of these principles will dramatically increase the
likelihood your security architecture will maintain assurances of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Each recommendation in this document includes a description of why it is
recommended, which maps to one of more of these principles:

- **Align Security Priorities to Mission –** Security resources are almost
    always limited, so prioritize efforts and assurances by aligning security
    strategy and technical controls to the business using classification of data
    and systems. Security resources should be focused first on people and assets
    (systems, data, accounts, etc.) with intrinsic business value and those with
    administrative privileges over business critical assets.

- **Build a Comprehensive Strategy –** A security strategy should consider
    investments in culture, processes, and security controls across all system
    components. The strategy should also consider security for the full
    lifecycle of system components including the supply chain of software,
    hardware, and services.

- **Drive Simplicity –** Complexity in systems leads to increased human
    confusion, errors, automation failures, and difficulty of recovering from an
    issue. Favor simple and consistent architectures and implementations.

- **Design for Attackers –** Your security design and prioritization should be
    focused on the way attackers see your environment, which is often not the
    way IT and application teams see it. Inform your security design and test it
    with **penetration testing** to simulate one-time attacks. Use **red teams** to
    simulate long-term persistent attack groups. Design your enterprise
    segmentation strategy and other security controls to **contain** attacker
    lateral movement within your environment. Actively measure and reduce the
    potential **attack surface** that attackers target for exploitation of
    resources within the environment.

- **Leverage Native Controls –** Favor native security controls built into
    cloud services over external controls from third parties. Native security
    controls are maintained and supported by the service provider, eliminating
    or reducing effort required to integrate external security tooling and
    update those integrations over time.

- **Use Identity as Primary Access Control –** Access to resources in cloud
    architectures is primarily governed by identity-based authentication and
    authorization for access controls. Your account control strategy should rely
    on identity systems for controlling access rather than relying on network
    controls or direct use of cryptographic keys.

- **Accountability** – Designate clear ownership of assets and security
    responsibilities and ensure actions are traceable for nonrepudiation. You
    should also ensure entities have been granted the least privilege required
    (to a manageable level of granularity).

- <a id="embrace-automation"></a>**Embrace Automation -** Automation of tasks decreases the chance of human
    error that can create risk, so both IT operations and security best
    practices should be automated as much as possible to reduce human errors
    (while ensuring skilled humans govern and audit the automation).

- **Focus on Information Protection –** Intellectual property is frequently
    one of the biggest repositories of organizational value and this data should
    be protected anywhere it goes including cloud services, mobile devices,
    workstations, or collaboration platforms (without impeding collaboration
    that allows for business value creation). Your security strategy should be
    built around classifying information and assets to enable security
    prioritization, leveraging strong access control and encryption technology,
    and meeting business needs like productivity, usability, and flexibility.

- **Design for Resilience –** Your security strategy should assume that
    controls will fail and design accordingly. Making your security posture more
    resilient requires several approaches working together:

    -   *Balanced Investment* – Invest across core functions spanning the full [NIST
        Cybersecurity Framework lifecycle](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
        (identify, protect, detect, respond,
        and recover) to ensure that attackers who successfully evade preventive
        controls lose access from detection, response, and recovery
        capabilities.

    -   *Ongoing Maintenance* – Maintain security controls and assurances to ensure
        that they don’t decay over time with changes to the environment or
        neglect.

    -   *Ongoing Vigilance* – Ensure that anomalies and potential threats
        that could pose risks to the organizations are addressed in a timely
        manner.

    -   *Defense in Depth* – Consider additional controls in the design
        to mitigate risk to the organization in the event a primary security
        control fails. This design should consider how likely the primary
        control is to fail, the potential organizational risk if it does, and
        the effectiveness of the additional control (especially in the likely
        cases that would cause the primary control to fail).

    -   *Least Privilege* – This is a form of defense in depth to limit the
        damage that can be done by any one account. Accounts should be granted
        the least amount of privilege required to accomplish their assigned
        tasks. Restrict the access by permission level and by time. This helps mitigate the damage
        of an external attacker who gains access to the account and/or an
        internal employee who inadvertently or deliberately (for example, insider
        attack) compromises security assurances.

- **Baseline and Benchmark –** To ensure your organization considers current
    thinking from outside sources, evaluate your strategy and configuration
    against external references (including compliance requirements). This helps
    to validate your approaches, minimize risk of inadvertent oversight, and the
    risk of punitive fines for noncompliance.

- **Drive Continuous Improvement –** Systems and existing practices should be
    regularly evaluated and improved to ensure they are and remain effective
    against attackers who continuously improve and the continuous digital
    transformation of the enterprise. This should include processes that
    proactively integrate learnings from real world attacks, realistic
    penetration testing and red team activities, and other sources as available.

- **Assume Zero Trust –** When evaluating access requests, all requesting
    users, devices, and applications should be considered untrusted until their
    integrity can be sufficiently validated. Access requests should be granted
    conditionally based on the requestor's trust level and the target resource’s
    sensitivity. Reasonable attempts should be made to offer means to increase
    trust validation (for example, request multi-factor authentication) and remediate
    known risks (change known-leaked password, remediate malware infection) to
    support productivity goals.

- **Educate and Incentivize Security –** The humans that are designing and
    operating the cloud workloads are part of the whole system. It is critical
    to ensure that these people are educated, informed, and incentivized to support
    the security assurance goals of the system. This is particularly important
    for people with accounts granted broad administrative privileges.
