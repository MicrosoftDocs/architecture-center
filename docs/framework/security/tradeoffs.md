# tradeoffs

Much like physical safety, success in information security is defined more as an
ongoing task of applying good security practices and principles and hygiene
rather than a static absolute state. Reducing risk for your security program
should be aligned to your organizations mission and shaped by three key
strategic directions:

-   Building **resilience** into your cybersecurity strategy

-   Strategically **increasing attacker cost**

-   Tactically **containing attacker access**.<!-- You have built the appropriate level of resilience into your security infrastructure -->

<!-- You have balanced attacker cost versus your own -->
