# What do the law, authorities, and regulators require?

Governments and other organizations frequently publish standards to help define
good security practices (due diligence) so that organizations can avoid being
negligent in security. The purpose and scope of these standards and regulations
vary, but the security requirements typically influence the design for data
protection and retention, data privacy, and system security.

Cloud architecture has fundamentally changed the responsibilities of operating
an IT service, which can introduce challenges with strictly applying these
standards to cloud workloads. Good security practices like those described in
this document frequently align well to the established security recommendations
and requirements in these standards. Some recommendations in standards are more
difficult to adapt to the cloud because some outdated security practices won’t
sufficiently protect cloud workloads. Additionally, focusing too much on
outdated approaches can divert resources from more effective modern protections.

Because of these potential challenges and the potential fines or other business
impact of noncompliance, we recommend working with your regulators and carefully
reviewing the standards to understand both the intent and the literal wording.
