# Security operations

Security operations maintain and restores the security assurances of the system
as live adversaries attack it. The tasks of security operations are
described well by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions of Detect, Respond,
and Recover.

- **Detect** - Security operations must detect the presence of adversaries in
    the system, who are incented to stay hidden in most cases as this allows
    them to achieve their objectives unimpeded. This can take the form of
    reacting to an alert of suspicious activity or proactively hunting for
    anomalous events in the enterprise activity logs.

- **Respond** – Upon detection of potential adversary action or campaign,
    security operations must rapidly investigate to identify whether it is an
    actual attack (true positive) or a false alarm (false positive) and then
    enumerate the scope and goal of the adversary operation.

- **Recover** – The ultimate goal of security operations is to preserve or
    restore the security assurances (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
    of business services during and after an attack.

The most significant security risk most organizations face is from human attack
operators (of varying skill levels). This is because risk from
automated/repeated attacks have been mitigated significantly for most
organizations by signature and machine learning based approaches built into
anti-malware (though there are notable exceptions like Wannacrypt and NotPetya, which moved faster than these defenses).

While human attack operators are challenging to face because of their
adaptability (vs. automated/repeated logic), they are operating at the same
“human speed” as defenders, which help level the playing field.

Security Operations (sometimes referred to as a Security Operations Center
(SOC)) has a critical role to play in limiting the time and access an attacker
can get to valuable systems and data. Each minute that an attacker has in the
environment allows them to continue to conduct attack operations and access
sensitive/valuable systems.

## Objective and metrics

The metrics you measure will have a significant effect on the behaviors and
outcomes of security operations. Focusing on the right measurements will help
drive continuous improvement in the right areas that meaningfully reduce risk.

To ensure that security operations are effectively containing attackers access,
the objectives should focus on

- Reducing **time to acknowledge** an alert to ensure that detected
    adversaries are not ignored while defenders are spending time investigating
    false positives.

- Reducing **time to remediate** a discovered adversary to reduce their
    opportunity time to conduct and attack and reach sensitive systems

- **Prioritizing** security investments into systems that have high intrinsic
    value (likely targets / high business impact) and access to many systems or
    sensitive systems (administrator accounts and sensitive users)

- Increase focus on **proactively hunting** for adversaries as your program
    matures and reactive incidents get under control. This is focused on
    reducing the time that a higher skilled adversary can operate in the
    environment (for example, skilled enough to evade reactive alerts).

For more information on how Microsoft’s SOC uses these metrics, see

## Hybrid enterprise view

Security operations should ensure their tooling, processes, and analyst
skillsets enable visibility across the full span of their hybrid estate.

Attackers don’t restrict their actions to a particular environment when
targeting an organization, they will attack resources on any platform using any
method available. Enterprise organizations adopting cloud services like Azure
and AWS are effectively operating a hybrid of cloud and on-premises assets.

Security operations tooling and processes should be designed for attacks on
cloud and on-premises assets as well as attackers pivoting between cloud and
on-premises resources using identity or other means. This enterprise-wide view
will enable security operations teams to rapidly detect, respond, and recover
from attacks, reducing organizational risk.

## Leverage native detections and controls

You should favor the use of security detections and controls built into the
cloud platform before creating custom detections using event logs from the
cloud.

Cloud platforms evolve rapidly with new features, which can make maintaining
detections challenging. Native controls are maintained by the cloud provider and
are typically high quality (low false positive rate).

Because many organizations may use multiple cloud platforms and need a unified
view across the enterprise, you should ensure these native detections and
controls feed a centralize SIEM or other tool. We don’t recommend trying to
substitute generalized log analysis tools and queries instead of native
detections and controls. These tools can offer numerous values for proactive
hunting activities, but getting to a high-quality alert with these tools
requires application of deep expertise and time that could be better spent on
hunting and other activities.

To complement the broad visibility of a centralized SIEM (like Azure Sentinel,
Splunk, or QRadar), you should leverage native detections and controls such as

- Organizations using Azure should leverage capabilities like Azure Security
    Center for alert generation on the Azure platform.

- Organizations should leverage native logging capabilities like Azure Monitor
    and AWS CloudTrail for pulling logs into a central view

- Organizations using Azure should leverage Network Security Group (NSG)
    capabilities for visibility into network activities on the Azure platform.

- Investigation practices should leverage native tools with deep knowledge of
    the asset type such as an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution,
    Identity tools, and Azure Sentinel.

## Prioritize alert and log integration

Ensure that you are integrating critical security alerts and logs into SIEMs
without introducing a high volume of low value data.

Introducing too much low value data can increase SIEM cost, increase noise and
false positives, and lower performance.

The data you collect should be focused on supporting one or more of these
operations activities:

- **Alerts** (detections from existing tools or data required for generating
    custom alerts)

- **Investigation** of an incident (for example, required for common queries)

- Proactive **hunting** activities

Integrating more data can allow you to enrich alerts with additional context
that enable rapid response and remediation (filter false positives, and elevate
true positives, etc.), but collection is not detection. If you don’t have a
reasonable expectation that the data will provide value (for example, high volume of firewall denies events), you may deprioritize integration of these events.
