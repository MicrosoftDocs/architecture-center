# Security patterns

Security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against malicious attacks on information systems (and safety assurances for attacks on operational technology systems). Losing these assurances can negatively impact your business operations and revenue, as well as your organizationâ€™s reputation in the marketplace. Maintaining security requires following well-established practices (security hygiene) and being vigilant to detect and rapidly remediate vulnerabilities and active attacks.

## Patterns

|                    Pattern                     |                                                                                                         Summary                                                                                                         |

|         [Gatekeeper](../../patterns/gatekeeper.md)         | Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance that acts as a broker between clients and the application or service, validates and sanitizes requests, and passes requests and data between them. |
|          [Valet Key](../../patterns/valet-key.md)          |                                                        Use a token or key that provides clients with restricted direct access to a specific resource or service.                                                        |

### Security Resiliency

Achieving security resilience requires a combination of preventive measures to block attacks, responsive measures detect and quickly remediate active attacks, and governance to ensure consistent application of best practices.

- **Security strategy** should include lessons learned described in [security strategy guidance](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-security-strategy).
- **Azure security configurations** should align to the best practices and controls in the [Azure Security Benchmark (ASB)](/azure/security/benchmarks/). Security configurations for Azure services should align to the [Security baselines for Azure](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview) in the ASB.
- **Azure architectures** should integrate native security capabilities to protect and monitor workloads including [Azure Defender](/azure/security-center/azure-defender), [Azure DDoS protection](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview), [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/), and [Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/azure/web-application-firewall/).
