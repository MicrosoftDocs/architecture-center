# Network security and containment

Network security has been the traditional lynchpin of enterprise security efforts. However, cloud computing has increased the requirement for network perimeters to be more porous and many attackers have mastered the art of attacks on identity system elements (which nearly always bypass network controls). These factors have increased the need to focus primarily on identity-based access controls to protect resources rather than network-based access controls.
