# What types of attack should the architecture resist?

An architecture built on good security practices should be resilient to attacks. It should both resist attacks and recover rapidly from disruption to the security assurances of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Because security resources are always limited, it is critical to discover and prioritize risks based on the mission of the organization. This activity should use the best possible data sources available, which can come from:

- **Experience and data:** Services, applications, and architectures that already have been in production can use real world data from attacks and experience to guide prioritization of security investments to mitigate risks. These types of systems sometimes have clearly defined actionable best practices like the ones that are included in this document.

- **Threat modeling:** Newly defined systems such as applications in development (or modifications to them) donâ€™t have real world data on the top vectors attackers would target, so you must rely more on a model of possible and likely vectors to guide risk mitigation. Threat modeling is a structured process to applying security expertise that models the possible attack vectors and prioritize the most likely/damaging threats, allowing you to prioritize risk mitigate efforts. Threat modeling can also be applied to existing systems or a combination of systems.

This document focuses on sharing clearly defined good security practices as well as guidance on applying [threat modeling to your applications and architectures](./design-apps-services.md).
