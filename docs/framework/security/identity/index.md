# Identity and access management

In cloud-focused architecture, identity provides the basis of a large percentage of security assurances. While legacy IT infrastructure often heavily relied on firewalls and network security solutions at the internet egress points for protection against outside threats, these controls are less effective in cloud architectures with shared services being accessed across cloud provider networks or the internet.
