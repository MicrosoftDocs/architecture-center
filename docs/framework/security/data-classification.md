# Data classification

## Data classification strategy

The process of data classification allows organizations to categorize their stored data by sensitivity and business impact in order to determine the risks associated with the data.

## Ensure appropriate action after classification

After the process is completed, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect its value to them instead of treating all data the same way.

## What to do if there is a breach

You'll need to pin down exactly what kind of information was lost in the data breach

## Where's the data

Where customer data actually ends up has long been a concern. Doubts as to the answer are something often cited by opponents of the trend towards cloud services.
