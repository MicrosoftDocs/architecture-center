# Architecting cloud environments

The purpose of this guide is offering a framework to evaluate whether your application is correctly architected in the cloud. You should consider your cloud architecture from different perspectives:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Scalability][scalability] | The ability of a system to handle variable load. |
| [Cost][cost] | The infrastructure should be optimized to reduce costs as much as possible. |
| [Resiliency][resiliency] | The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. |
| [DevOps][devops] | Operations processes that ensure a system running in production effectively over time. |
| [Security][security] | Protecting applications and data from threats. |

[devops]: ./devops/overview.md
[resiliency]: ./resiliency/overview.md
[security]: ./security/overview.md
[cost]: ./cost/overview.md
