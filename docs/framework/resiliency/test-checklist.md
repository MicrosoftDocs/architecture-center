# Testing for reliability

Regular testing should be performed as part of each major change and if possible, on a regular basis to validate existing thresholds, targets and assumptions. Testing should also ensure the validity of the health model, capacity model, and operational procedures.

## Checklist

**Have you tested your applications with reliability in mind?**
***

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Test regularly to validate existing thresholds, targets and assumptions.
> - Automate testing as much as possible.
> - Perform testing on both key test environments with the production environment.
> - Perform chaos testing by injecting faults.
> - Create and test a disaster recovery plan on a regular basis using key failure scenarios.
> - Design disaster recovery strategy to run most applications with reduced functionality.
> - Design a backup strategy that is tailored to business requirements and circumstances of the application.
> - Test and validate the failover and failback approach successfully at least once.
> - Configure request timeouts to manage inter-component calls.
> - Implement retry logic to handle transient application failures and transient failures with internal or external dependencies.
> - Configure and test health probes for your load balancers and traffic managers.
> - Apply chaos principles continuously.
> - Create and organize a central chaos engineering team.

## In this section

Follow these questions to assess the workload at a deeper level.

| Assessment | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [How do you test the application to ensure it is fault tolerant?](./testing.md) | Test regularly to validate existing thresholds, targets and assumptions. Automate testing as much as possible.
| [How are you handling disaster recovery for your application?](./backup-and-recovery.md) | A disaster recovery plan is considered complete after it has been fully tested. Include the people, processes, and applications needed to restore functionality within the service-level agreement (SLA).
| [How are you managing errors & failures?](./app-design-error-handling.md) | Testing doesn't always catch everything. Ensure that your application can recover from errors in a critical when working in a distributed system.
| [How do you chaos-engineer your applications to ensure that they're fault tolerant?](./chaos-engineering.md) | Deliberately inject faults that cause system components to fail. This can be done in a production or non-production environment.
