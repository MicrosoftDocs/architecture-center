## There is a response plan in place for network outages.

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

When parts of the Azure network are inaccessible, you might not be able to access your application or data. In this situation, we recommend designing the disaster recovery strategy to run most applications with reduced functionality.

If reducing functionality isn't an option, the remaining options are application downtime or failover to an alternate region.

In a reduced functionality scenario:

- If your application can't access its data because of an Azure network outage, you might be able to run locally with reduced application functionality by using cached data.
- You might be able to store data in an alternate location until connectivity is restored.
