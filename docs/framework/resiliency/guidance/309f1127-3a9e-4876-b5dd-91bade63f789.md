## Application components are split with seperate health probes

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Inability to detect and avoid sending requests to failed instances minimizes availability.</p></div>

Configure and test health probes for your load balancers and traffic managers. Ensure that your health endpoint checks the critical parts of the system and responds appropriately.

- For [Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview/), the health probe determines whether to fail over to another region. Your health endpoint should check any critical dependencies that are deployed within the same region.
- For [Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview/), the health probe determines whether to remove a VM from rotation. The health endpoint should report the health of the VM. Don't include other tiers or external services. Otherwise, a failure that occurs outside the VM will cause the load balancer to remove the VM from rotation.

For guidance on implementing health monitoring in your application, see [Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern](../patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring.md).
