## You have an early warning system for workloads where that makes sense.

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

Monitor your application for warning signs that might require proactive intervention. Tools that assess the overall health of the application and its dependencies help you to recognize quickly when a system or its components suddenly become unavailable. Use them to implement an early warning system.

1. Identify the key performance indicators of your application's health, such as transient exceptions and remote call latency.
1. Set thresholds at levels that identify issues before they become critical and require a recovery response.
1. Send an alert to operations when the threshold value is reached.

Consider [Microsoft System Center 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/system-center) or third-party tools to provide monitoring capabilities. Most monitoring solutions track key performance counters and service availability. [Azure resource health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-checks-resource-types) provides some built-in health status checks,Â which can help diagnose throttling of Azure services.
