## Perform Load Testing

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Test applications under strain to ensure they stay available</p></div>

Load testing is crucial for identifying failures that only happen under load, such as the back-end database being overwhelmed or service throttling. Test for peak load and anticipated increase in peak load, using production data or synthetic data that is as close to production data as possible. Your goal is to see how the application behaves under real-world conditions.
