## Resource management

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

You can distribute compute instances across regions by creating a separate cloud service in each target region, and then publishing the deployment package to each cloud service. However, distributing traffic across cloud services in different regions must be implemented by the application developer or with a traffic management service.

Determining the number of spare role instances to deploy in advance for disaster recovery is an important aspect of capacity planning. Having a full-scale secondary deployment ensures that capacity is already available when needed; however, this effectively doubles the cost. A common pattern is to have a small, secondary deployment, just large enough to run critical services. This small secondary deployment is a good idea, both to reserve capacity, and for testing the configuration of the secondary environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The subscription quota is not a capacity guarantee. The quota is simply a credit limit. To guarantee capacity, the required number of roles must be defined in the service model, and the roles must be deployed.
