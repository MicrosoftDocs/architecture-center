## Backup & restore operations are automatically scheduled and tested

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Unscheduled and untested backup/restore operations are a risk to continued availability if they do not meet the recovery point objective (RPO).</p></div>

Test failover and failback to verify that your application's dependent services come back up in a synchronized manner during disaster recovery. Changes to systems and operations may affect failover and failback functions, but the impact may not be detected until the main system fails or becomes overloaded. Test failover capabilities *before* they are required to compensate for a live problem. Also be sure that dependent services fail over and fail back in the correct order.

If you are using [Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/) to replicate VMs, run disaster recovery drills periodically by doing test failovers to validate your replication strategy. A test failover does not affect the ongoing VM replication or your production environment. For more information, see [Run a disaster recovery drill to Azure](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure).
