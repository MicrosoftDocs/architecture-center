## Regional failure plans are documented

<div class="alert is-info"><p>When you run production workloads on cloud, you might use a globally distributed system so that if something goes wrong in one region, the application continues to provide service even if it's less widely available. In essence, that application invokes its DR plan.</p></div>

Azure is divided physically and logically into units called regions. A region consists of one or more datacenters in close proximity.

Under rare circumstances, it is possible that facilities in an entire region can become inaccessible, for example due to network failures. Or facilities can be lost entirely, for example due to a natural disaster. This section explains the capabilities of Azure for creating applications that are distributed across regions. Such distribution helps to minimize the possibility that a failure in one region could affect other regions.

Review [Recover from loss of an Azure region](/azure/architecture/resiliency/recovery-loss-azure-region.md) for guidance on specific Azure services.
