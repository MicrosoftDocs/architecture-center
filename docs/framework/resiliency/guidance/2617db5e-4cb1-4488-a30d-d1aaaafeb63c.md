## You have identified distinct workloads.

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

Cloud solutions typically consist of multiple application *workloads*. A workload is a distinct capability or task that is logically separated from other tasks in terms of business logic and data storage requirements. For example, an e-commerce app might have the following workloads:

- Browse and search a product catalog.
- Create and track orders.
- View recommendations.

Each workload has different requirements for availability, scalability, data consistency, and disaster recovery. Make your business decisions by balancing cost versus risk for each workload.

Also decompose workloads by service-level objective. If a service is composed of critical and less-critical workloads, manage them differently and specify the service features and number of instances needed to meet their availability requirements.
