## You monitor your long-running workflows for failures.

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

Long-running workflows often include multiple steps, each of which should be independent.

Track the progress of long-running processes to minimize the likelihood that the entire workflow will need to be rolled back or that multiple compensating transactions will need to be executed.

>[!TIP]
> Monitor and manage the progress of long-running workflows by implementing a pattern such as [Scheduler Agent Supervisor](../patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor.md).
