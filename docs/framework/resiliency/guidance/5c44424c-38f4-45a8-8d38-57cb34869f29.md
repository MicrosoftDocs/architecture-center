## Request timeouts are configured

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Very short timeouts can cause excessive retry operations for services and resources that have considerable latency. Very long timeouts can cause blocking if a large number of requests are queued, waiting for a service or resource to respond.</p></div>

Set SQL Connection timeout to 30s. Use guidance on troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and transient errors for SQL Database.
