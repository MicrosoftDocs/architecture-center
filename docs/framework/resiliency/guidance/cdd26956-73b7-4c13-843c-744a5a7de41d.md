## You have validated that your monitoring system is functional.

<div class="alert is-warning"><p></p></div>

Include monitoring systems in your test plan. Automated failover and failback systems depend on the correct functioning of monitoring and instrumentation. Dashboards to visualize system health and operator alerts also depend on having accurate monitoring and instrumentation. If these elements fail, miss critical information, or report inaccurate data, an operator might not realize that the system is unhealthy or failing.
