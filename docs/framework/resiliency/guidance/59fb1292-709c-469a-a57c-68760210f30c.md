## Error logging (heading)

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Inability to provide sufficient data to enable operations staff to determine the cause, mitigate the situation, and ensure availability.</p></div>

Use Azure Log Analytics for a detailed reporting on errors and failures. Employ Service Map and Application Map for coherent error/failure reporting.
