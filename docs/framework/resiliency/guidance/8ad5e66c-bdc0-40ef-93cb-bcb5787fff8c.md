## Availability Sets are used for each application tier

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>An availability set helps keep your virtual machines available during downtime, such as during maintenance.</p></div>

Placing two or more similarly configured virtual machines in an availability set creates the redundancy needed to maintain availability of the applications or services that your virtual machine runs.
