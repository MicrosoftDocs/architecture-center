## Using horizontal scaling when possible

<div class="alert is-warning"><p>Also called scaling out and in, means adding or removing instances of a resource. The application continues running without interruption as new resources are provisioned. When the provisioning process is complete, the solution is deployed on these additional resources. If demand drops, the additional resources can be shut down cleanly and deallocated.</p></div>

Horizontal scaling allows you to dynamically add and remove resources based on demand.
