## Configured scaling policies using the appropriate metrics

<div class="alert is-danger"><p>Scaling on the correct metrics is critical to responding quickly to changes in demands and adding resources at the appropriate time.</p></div>

Autoscaling rules that use a detection mechanism based on a measured trigger attribute (such as CPU usage or queue length) use an aggregated value over time, rather than instantaneous values, to trigger an autoscaling action. By default, the aggregate is an average of the values. This prevents the system from reacting too quickly, or causing rapid oscillation.
