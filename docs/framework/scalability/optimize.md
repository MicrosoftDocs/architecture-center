# Optimize for scalability and reliability
Resolving performance issues requires time and patience&mdash;not just in discovery and investigation, but also in resolution. Code enhancements may be accomplished by deploying a new build, but enhancements to infrastructure may involve many teams. Some services may require updated configurations while others may need to be deprecated in favor of more-appropriate solutions. Regardless, it is critical that you understand the scope of your planned resolution so that all necessary stakeholders are informed.
## Checklist
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Use caching whenever possible, whether it is client-side caching, view caching, or data caching.
> - Partition data to optimize performance, improve scalability, and reduce contention by lowering the taxation of database operations.
> - Prevent a system from attempting to scale out excessively. Gracefully degrading the functionality that the system provides if the maximum number of instances have been deployed, and the system is still overloaded. 
> - Improve the reliability of your workloads by implementing high availability, disaster recovery, backup, and monitoring in Azure.

## In this section

Follow these questions to assess the workload at a deeper level.

|Assessment|Description|
|---|---|
|[**Has caching and queuing been considered to handle varying load?**](optimize-cache.md)|Caching and queuing offers ways to handle heavy load in read and write scenarios, respectively. However, their usage must be carefully considered as this may mean that data is not fresh and writes to not happen instantly. This could create a scenario of eventual consistency and stale data.|
|[**Are you using database replicas and data partitioning?**](optimize-partition.md)|Collect platform metrics and logs to get visibility into the health and performance of services that are part of the architecture.|
|[**Has autoscaling been tested under sustained load?**](optimize-sustain.md))|Implement a unified solution to aggregate and query application and resource level logs, such as Azure Log Analytics.|
|[**Are the right sizes and SKUs used for workload services?**](design-capacity.md#choose-the-right-resources)|The required performance and infrastructure utilization are key factors which define the 'size' of Azure resources to be used, but there can be hidden aspects that affect cost too. Once the purchased SKUs have been identified, determine if they purchased resources have the capabilities of supporting anticipated load.|
|[**Is the application implemented with strategies for resiliency and self-healing?**](performance-efficiency-patterns.md)|Consider implementing strategies and capabilities for resiliency and self-healing needed to achieve workload availability targets. Programming paradigms such as retry patterns, request timeouts, and circuit breaker patterns can improve application resiliency by automatically recovering from transient faults.|

## Capacity considerations
- **Technology & SKU service limits** - For disaster recovery, it is important that you choose [_paired regions_](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) for deploying your application. This is to ensure that your application operates at maximum uptime. Additionally, it is critical that your chosen regions support the necessary service SKUs and limits to support load if one region should fail. In the event that a single region fails, your services should be able to scale to the appropriate levels for accommodating increased demand from the rerouted requests. Your performance testing should occasionally include testing during a simulated failover to ensure application efficiency under those conditions. If it is determined that a service's limits in a single region cannot support the increased load, additional services should be deployed in your regions, or additional regions should be added to your load balancer.

- **SLAs** - When determining which services you will use within your application, you should also consider the SLAs of those services as their SLAs can affect your application's performance. When the _functional_ capabilities of two services overlap, then the SLAs of those services could be the determining factor why one is chosen over the other.

- **Costs** - Costs can be an additional factor in performance efficiency. Surprisingly, however, greater costs don't necessarily always mean increased performance. But, when observing how close your application comes to meeting business KPIs, you must consider how much improvement will be realized in the application if costs are increased. Then, you must evaluate if the cost-benefit is worth the investment. Sometimes, small changes in the application logic, caching, or adding an index to a database can dramatically improve performance while not affecting costs whatsoever (certain improvements can even help reduce costs).

## Next section

Compare your code to proven architectures. By referencing the design patterns, you can avoid common mistakes by developers who are deploying applications into the cloud. Finally, you may consider other Azure services that may be more appropriate for your objectives. While Azure has many services that seem to overlap in capabilities, often there are specific use-cases for which the services are designed.
