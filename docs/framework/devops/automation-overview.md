# Automation overview: Goals, best practices, and types

Automation has revolutionized how businesses operate and this trend continues to evolve. Businesses have moved to automating manual processes so that engineers can focus attention on tasks that add business value. Automating business solutions allow you to:

- Activate resources on demand.
- Deploy solutions rapidly.
- Minimize human error in configuring repetitive tasks.
- Produce consistent and repeatable results.

To learn more, see [Deployment considerations for automation](./deployment.md#automation).

## Goals of automation

When automating technical processes and configurations, a common approach for some organizations is to automate what they can and leave the more difficult processes for humans to perform manually.

A goal of automation is to make tools that do what humans can do, only better. For example, a human can perform any given task once. But when the task requires repetitive runs, especially over long time periods, an automated system is better equipped to do this with more predictable results that are error-free. Increasing speed is another goal in automation. When you practice these automation goals, you can build systems that are faster, repetitive, and can run on a daily basis.

## Automate toil to improve efficiency

Most automation involves a percentage of *toil*. Toil is the operational work that is related to a process that is manual, repetitive, can be automated, and has minimal value. It is counterproductive to automation but in many organizations, a small amount of toil is unavoidable. It becomes an issue when too much toil slows progress. A project's production velocity will decrease if engineers are continuously interrupted by manual tasks attributed to toil, either planned or unplanned. Too much toil can impact job satisfaction. Engineers become dissatisfied when they find themselves spending too much time on operational toil rather than on other projects.

Automation should be developed, and increased, so engineers can eliminate future toil. By reducing toil, engineers can concentrate on innovating business solutions.

For more information, see [Toil automation](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/developing-a-google-sre-culture/toil-automation-BpNqj).

## Automation best practices

- **Ensure consistency** – The more manual processes are involved, the more prone to human error. This can lead to mistakes, oversights, reduction of data quality, and reliability problems.
- **Centralize mistakes** – Choose a platform to allow you to fix bugs in one place in order to fix them everywhere. This eliminates the need for communicating with other humans which increases chance of error and the possibility of the bug being re-introduced.
- **Identify issues quickly** – Complex issue may not always be able to be identified in a timely manner. However, with good automation, detection of these issues should occur quickly.
- **Maximize employee productivity** – Automation leads to more innovative solutions, additional automation, and in general provide more value to the business. This in turn raises morale and job satisfaction. Automation does not replace jobs with technology. For example, once a process is automated, training and maintenance can be greatly reduced or eliminated. This frees engineers to spend less time on manual processes and more time on automating business solutions.

## Types of automation

Three types of automation are described in this article: infrastructure deployment, infrastructure configuration, and operational tasks. These categories share the same goals and best practices mentioned previously. They differ in areas where Azure provides solutions that help achieve optimal automation. Other types of automation such as continuous deployment and continuous delivery are described further in the Operational Excellence pillar.

### Infrastructure deployment

As businesses move to the cloud, they need to *repeatedly* deploy their solutions and know that their infrastructure is in a *reliable state*. To meet these challenges, you can automate deployments using a practice referred to as [infrastructure as code](./automation-infrastructure.md). In code, you define the infrastructure that needs to be deployed.

Although there are many deployment technologies you can use with Azure, this article describes two of the more popular technologies:

- [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](./automation-infrastructure.md#automate-deployments-with-arm-templates)
- [Terraform](./automation-infrastructure.md#automate-deployments-with-terraform)

These technologies use a *declarative* approach. This lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. You can deploy not only virtual machines, but also the network infrastructure, storage systems, and any other resources you may need.
 
### Infrastructure configuration

If you don't manage configuration carefully, your business could encounter disruptions such as systems outages and security issues. Optimal configuration can enable you to quickly detect and correct configurations that could interrupt or slow performance.

Configurations such as installing software on a virtual machine, adding data to a database, or starting pods in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster need to access Azure through an endpoint that is specific to your instance, outside of the exposed REST APIs. This enables the configuration tools to use agents, networking, or other access methods to provide resource-specific configuration options.

For example, when deploying to Azure, you may need to run post-deployment virtual machine configuration or run other arbitrary code to [bootstrap](./automation-configuration.md#bootstrap-automation) the deployed Azure resources. Another example is configuration tools that can be used to [configure and manage](./automation-configuration.md#configuration-management) the ongoing configuration and state of Azure virtual machines.

### Operational tasks

As the demand for speed in performing operational tasks increases over time, you are expected to deliver things faster and faster. The old way of manually performing operational tasks won't scale to that type of demand now. This is where automation can help. To meet on-demand delivery using an automation platform, you need to develop automation components (such runbooks and configurations), create integrations to systems that are already in place efficiently, and operate and troubleshoot.

Advantages of automating operational tasks include:

- Optimize and extend existing processes (for example, using a PowerShell module or REST API).
- Deliver flexible and reliable services.
- Lower costs.
- Improve predictability.

Two popular options for automating operational tasks are:

- [**Azure functions**](./automation-tasks.md#azure-functions) - Run code without managing the underlying infrastructure on where the code is run.
- [**Azure automation**](./automation-tasks.md#azure-automation)- Uses a programming language to automate operational tasks in code and executed on demand.

For more information, see [Automation](./automation-tasks.md). To see a Microsoft Ignite video, see [Automating Operational and Management Tasks](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/microsoft-ignite-2015-automating-operational-and-management-tasks-using-azure-automation/).
