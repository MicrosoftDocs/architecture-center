# Application design for DevOps

## Infrastructure as code

Use Azure Resource Manager templates to ensure that investments for one location are reusable in another.

## Dependency tracking

Use Azure Resource Manager templates to define dependencies for resources that are deployed in the same template.

## Limits

## Tagging and resource naming

## Workload isolation 

## Orchestration system

## Containerization

Use VSTS hosted CI/CD for containers to create and deploy containers.
