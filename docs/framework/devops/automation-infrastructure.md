# Repeatable Infrastructure

Historically, deploying a new service or application involves manual work such as procuring and preparing hardware, configuring operating environments, and enabling monitoring solutions. Ideally, an organization would have multiple environments in which to test deployments. These test environments should be similar enough to production that deployment and run time issues are detected before deployment to production. This manual work takes time, is error-prone, and can produce inconsistencies between the environments if not done well.

Cloud computing changes the way we procure infrastructure. No longer are we unboxing, racking, and cabling physical infrastructure. We have internet accessible management portals and REST interfaces to help us. We can now provision virtual machines, databases, and other cloud services on demand and globally. When we no longer need cloud services, they can be easily deleted. However, cloud computing alone does not remove the effort and risk in provisioning infrastructure. When using a cloud portal to build systems, many of the same manual configuration tasks remain. Application servers require configuration, databases need networking, and firewalls need firewalling. 

## Why deploy infrastructure with code

To fully realize deployment optimization, reduce configuration effort, and automate full environments' deployment, something more is required. One option is referred to as infrastructure as code.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure - such as networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology - in a descriptive model, using a versioning system that is similar to what is used for source code. When you are creating an application, the same source code will generate the same binary every time it is compiled. In a similar manner, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice, and it is often used in conjunction with continuous delivery.

Ultimately, IaC allows you and your team to develop and release changes faster, but with much higher confidence in your deployments.

### Gain higher confidence

One of the biggest benefits of IaC is the level of confidence you can have in your deployments, and in your understanding of the infrastructure and its configuration.

**Integrate with your process.** If you have a process by which code changes are peer reviewed, you can use that same process for reviewing infrastructure changes. This review process can help proactively detect problematic configurations that are difficult to detect when making manual infrastructure changes.

**Consistency.** Following an IaC process ensures that the whole team follows a standard, well-established process. Historically, some organizations designate a single or small set of individuals responsible for deploying and configuring infrastructure. By following a fully automated process, responsibility for infrastructure deployments moves from individuals into the automation process and tooling. This move broadens the number of team members who can initiate infrastructure deployments while maintaining consistency and quality.

**Automated scanning.** Many types of IaC configurations can be scanned by automated tooling. One such type of tooling is linting to check for errors in the code. Another type will scan the proposed changes to your Azure infrastructure to ensure they follow security and performance best practices, for example, ensuring that storage accounts are configured to block unsecured connections. This can be an important part of a [Continuous Security](/learn/modules/explore-devops-continuous-security-operations/2-explore-continuous-security) approach.

**Secret management.** Most solutions require secrets to be maintained and managed. These include connection strings, API keys, client secrets, and certificates. Following an IaC approach means that you need to adopt best practices for managing secrets. For example, Azure Key Vault is used to store secrets securely. Key Vault can be integrated with many IaC tools and configurations to ensure that the person conducting the deployment doesn't need access to production secrets. Using a secret store with your infrastructure deployments ensures that you are adhering to the security principle of [least privilege](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege).

**Access control.** A fully automated IaC deployment pipeline means that an automated process should perform all changes to your infrastructure resources. [This approach has many security benefits](../security/security-principles.md#embrace-automation). By automating your deployments, you can be confident that changes deployed to your environment have followed the correct procedure, and you can even consider expanding the number of people who can initiate a deployment since the deployment itself is done in a fully automated way. Ideally, you would remove the ability for humans to manually modify your cloud resources and instead rely on the automated process. In case of emergencies, you may allow for this to be overridden, by using a ['break glass' account](/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access) or [Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/).

**Avoid configuration drift.** When using IaC, you can redeploy all of your environment templates on every release of your solution. IaC tooling is generally built to be idempotent (i.e. to be able to be run over and over again without any bad effects). Usually, the first deployment of a IaC configuration will actually deploy the configuration, while subsequent redeployments will essentially act as 'no-ops' and have no effect. This practice helps in a few ways:

* It ensures that your IaC configurations are regularly exercised. If they are only deployed occasionally, it's much more likely they will become stale and you won't notice until it's too late. This is particularly important if you need to rely on your IaC configurations as part of a disaster recovery plan.
* It ensures that your application code and infrastructure won't get out of sync. For example, if you have an application update that needs an IaC configuration to be deployed first (such as to deploy a new database), you want to make sure you won't accidentally forget to do this in the right order. Deploying the two together in one pipeline means you are less likely to encounter these kinds of 'race conditions'.
* It helps to avoid configuration drift. If someone does accidentally make a change to a resource without following your IaC pipeline, then you want to correct this as quickly as possible and get the resource back to the correct state. By following an IaC approach, the source of truth for your environment's configuration is in code.
 
### Manage multiple environments
Many organizations maintain multiple environments, for example, test, staging, and production. In some cases, multiple production environments are maintained for things like multi-tenanted solutions and geographically distributed applications. Ensuring consistency across these can be difficult; using infrastructure as code solutions can help.

**Manage non-production environments.** A common pain point for organizations is when non-production environments are dissimilar to production environments. Often, when building production and non-production environments by hand, the configuration of each will not match. This mismatch slows down the testing of changes and reduces confidence that changes will not harm a production system. When following an IaC approach, this problem is minimized. Using IaC automation, the same infrastructure configuration files can be used for all environments, producing almost identical environments. When needed, differentiation can be achieved using input parameters for each environment.

**Dynamically provision environments.** Once you have your IaC configurations defined, you can use them to provision new environments more efficiently. This agility can be enormously helpful when you're testing your solution. For example, you could quickly provision a duplicate of your production environment that can then be used for security penetration tests, load testing or help a developer track down a bug.

**Scale production environments.** Some organizations have the requirement to provision multiple production environments. For example, you may be following the [Deployment Stamps pattern](../../patterns/deployment-stamp.md), or you might need to create a new instance of your environment in another geographical region. IaC configurations can be used to deploy additional instances of your solution, ensuring consistency between all environments.

**Disaster recovery.** In some situations, where recovery time may not be time-sensitive, IaC configurations can be used as part of a disaster recovery plan. For example, if infrastructure needs to be recreated in a second region, your IaC configurations can be used to do so. You need to consider deployment time and things like handling disaster recovery for your databases, storage accounts, and other resources that store state. All things considered, using IaC does provide an option for rapid re-creation of infrastructural assets.

When planning for disaster and recovery, ensure that your disaster recovery plans are fully tested and that they meet your recovery time requirements. This process is often referred to as a [Recovery Time Objective](../resiliency/business-metrics.md#recovery-metrics)).

### Better understand your cloud resources
IaC can also help you better understand the state of your cloud resources.

**Audit changes.** Changes to your IaC configurations will be version-controlled in the same way as your code, such as through Git's version history. This means you can review each change that has happened, and understand who made it and when. This can be helpful if you're trying to understand why a resource is configured a specific way.

**Metadata.** Many types of IaC configurations let you add metadata, like code comments, to help explain why something is done a particular way. If your organization has a culture of documenting your code, apply the same principles to your infrastructure code.

**Keep everything together.** It's common for a developer to work on features that require both code and infrastructure changes. By keeping infrastructure defined as code, you can group application and infrastructure code to understand the relationship between them better. For example, if you see a change to an IaC configuration on a feature branch or in a pull request, you'll have a clearer understanding of what that change relates to.

**Better understand Azure itself.** The Azure portal is a great way to provision and configure resources; however, it often simplifies the underlying resource model used. Using IaC will mean that you gain a much deeper understanding of what is happening in Azure and how to troubleshoot it if something isn't working correctly. For example, when creating a set of virtual machines using the Azure portal, some of the underlying resource creation is abstracted for the deployment process. When using IaC not only do you have explicit control over resource creation, very little is abstracted from the process, which provides a much richer understanding of what is deployed and how it is configured.

## Categories of IaC tooling

You can use many declarative infrastructure deployment technologies with Azure. These fall into two main categories.

* **Imperative IaC** involves writing scripts in a language like Bash, PowerShell, C# script files, or Python. These programmatically execute a series of steps to create or modify your resources. When using imperative deployments, it is up to you to manage things like dependency sequencing, error control, and resource updates.
* **Declarative IaC** involves writing a definition of how you want your environment to look; the tooling then figures out how to make this happen by inspecting your current state, comparing it to the target state you've requested, and applying the differences. [There's a good discussion of imperative and declarative IaC here.](/learn/modules/azure-well-architected-operational-excellence/4-use-automation-to-reduce-effort-and-error)

There are great Azure tooling options for both models. Here we describe two of the commonly used declarative IaC technologies for Azure - ARM templates and Terraform.

## Automate deployments with ARM Templates

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates provide an Azure native infrastructure as code solution. ARM Templates are written in a language derived from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and they define the infrastructure and configurations for Azure deployments. An ARM template is declarative, you state what intend to deploy, provide configuration values, and the Azure engine takes care of making the necessary Azure REST API put requests. Additional benefits of using ARM templates for infrastructure deployments include:

- **Parallel resource deployment** - the Azure deployment engine sequences resource deployments based on defined dependencies. If dependencies do not exist between two resources, they are deployed at the same time.
- **Modular deployments** - ARM templates can be broken up into multiple template files for reusability and modularization.
- **Day one resource support** - ARM templates support all Azure resources and resource properties as they are released.
- **Extensibility** - Azure deployments can be extended using deployment scripts and other automation solutions.
- **Validation** - Azure deployments are evaluated against a validation API to catch configuration mistakes. 
- **Testing** - the [ARM template test toolkit](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/test-toolkit) provides a static code analysis framework for testing ARM templates.
- **Change preview** - [ARM template what-if](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-deploy-what-if?tabs=azure-powershell) allows you to see what will be changed before deploying an ARM template.
- **Tooling** - Language service extensions are available for both [Visual Studio Code](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-visual-studio-code) and [Visual Studio](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/create-visual-studio-deployment-project) to assist in authoring ARM templates.

The following example demonstrates a simple ARM template that deploys a single Azure Storage account. In this example, a single parameter is defined to take in a name for the storage account. Under the resources section, a storage account is defined, the *storageName* parameter is used to provide a name, and the storage account details are defined. See the included documentation for an in-depth explanation of the different sections and configurations for ARM templates.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "storageName": {
            "type": "string",
            "defaultValue": "newStorageAccount"
        }
    },
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "[parameters('storageName')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
            "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
            "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
            "kind": "StorageV2",
            "sku": {
                "name": "Premium_LRS",
                "tier": "Premium"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Automate deployments with Terraform

Terraform is a declarative framework for deploying and configuring infrastructure that supports many private and public clouds, Azure being one of them. It has the main advantage of offering a cloud-agnostic framework. While Terraform configurations are specific to each cloud, the framework itself is the same for all of them. Terraform configurations are written in a domain-specific language (DSL) called Hashicorp Configuration Language.

The following example demonstrates a simple Terraform configuration that deploys an Azure resource group and a single Azure Storage account.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "newStorageAccount"
  location = "eastus"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
}
```

Take note, the Terraform provider for Azure is an abstraction on top of Azure APIs. This abstraction is beneficial because the API complexities are obfuscated. This abstraction comes at a cost; the Terraform provider for Azure does not always provide parity with the Azure APIs' capabilities. To learn more about using Terraform on Azure, see [Using Terraform on Azure](/azure/developer/terraform/overview)

## Manual deployment

Manual deployment steps introduce significant risks where human error is concerned and also increases overall deployment times. However, in some cases, manual steps may be required. For these cases, ensure that any manual steps are documented, including roles and responsibilities.

## Hotfix process

In some cases, you may have an unplanned deployment need. For instance, to deploy critical hotfixes or security remediation patches. A defined process for unplanned deployments can help prevent service availability and other deployment issues during these critical events.
