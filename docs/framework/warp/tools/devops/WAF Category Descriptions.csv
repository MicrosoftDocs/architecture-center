Cost Optimization,Survey Level Group,A cost-effective workload is driven by business goals and the return on investment (ROI) while staying within a given budget. The principles of cost optimization are a series of important considerations that can help achieve both business objectives and cost justification. A capability program will enable you to begin optimizing the core components needed to manage your cloud environment.
Cost Optimization,Cost Model,Cost modeling is an exercise where you create logical groups of cloud resources that are mapped to the organization's hierarchy and then estimate costs for those groups. The goal of cost modeling is to estimate the overall cost of the organization in the cloud.
Cost Optimization,Architecture Design,"Break down high-level goals into functional requirements. For each of those requirements, define metrics to calculate cost estimates accurately. Cloud services are priced based on performance, features, and locations. When defining these metrics, identify acceptable boundaries of performance, scale, resilience, and security. Start by expressing your goals in number of business transactions over time, breaking them down to fine-grain requirements."
Cost Optimization,Monitor,"The goal of cost monitoring is to review cloud spend with the intent of establishing cost controls and preventing any misuse. The organization should adopt both proactive and reactive review approaches for monitoring cost. Effective cost reviews must be conducted by accountable stakeholders at a regular cadence. The reviews must be complemented with reactive cost reviews, for example when a budget limit causes an alert."
Cost Optimization,Optimize,Continually monitor and apply the right resources and sizes to workloads to achieve the most value for the services.

Performance Efficiency,Survey Level Group,"Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. Just as you needed to anticipate increases in load in on-premises environments, you need to anticipate increases in cloud environments to meet business requirements."
Performance Efficiency,Application Design,"Application design is critical to handling scale as load increases. It involves choosing the right data storage, database considerations, VM sizing, building with microservices and establishing connection pooling."
Performance Efficiency,Capacity Planning,"Plan for fluctuation in expected load that can occur because of world events. Test variations of load before the events, including unexpected ones, to ensure that your application can scale. Make sure all regions can adequately scale to support total load, if a region fail."
Performance Efficiency,Monitoring,"Troubleshooting an application's performance requires monitoring and reliable investigation. Issues in performance can arise from database queries, connectivity between services, under-provision resources, or memory leaks in code. Continuously monitoring services and checking the health state of current workloads is key in maintaining the overall performance of the workload."
Performance Efficiency,Performance Testing,"Performance testing helps to maintain systems properly and fix defects before problems reach system users. It helps maintain the efficiency, responsiveness, scalability, and speed of applications when compared with business requirements. When done effectively, performance testing should give you the diagnostic information necessary to eliminate bottlenecks, which lead to poor performance. A bottleneck occurs when data flow is either interrupted or stops due to insufficient capacity to handle the workload."
Performance Efficiency,Troubleshooting,"Issues in performance can arise from database queries, connectivity between services, under-provision resources, or memory leaks in code. Application telemetry and profiling can be useful tools for troubleshooting your application."
