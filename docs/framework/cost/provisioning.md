# Provisioning cloud resources to optimize cost

## Iterative capacity planning
One of the largest benefits of cloud computing is its rapid adaptability to changes in capacity. Having a good understanding of capacity requirements allows organizations to allocate resources with minimal overhead and grow/shrink on demand.

## Auto-scaling policies
For certain application, capacity requirements may swing over time. Auto-scaling policies allow for less error-prone operations and cost savings through robust automation.

## Right-sizing your resources
Certain infrastructure resources are delivered to customers as fix-sized building blocks. Ensuring that these building blocks are adequately sized is important to meet capacity demand as well as to eliminate waste.

## Choosing services that match business requirements
The number of cloud services in Azure continues to grow and services have similar overlapping features, capabilities and functionality. It is important for customers to select the service that match requirements at the most favorable cost profile.
