# Choose an Azure AI targeted language processing technology

[Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) help developers and organizations rapidly create intelligent, cutting-edge, market-ready, and responsible applications with out-of-the-box and prebuilt and customizable APIs and models.

This article covers AI services that provide targeted language processing capabilities such as natural language processing (NLP), text analytics, language understanding, translation, and document data extraction. Microsoft Azure AI Language is one of the broadest categories in AI services. You can use the APIs in your workload to incorporate language features like named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, language detection, and text summarization.

## Services

The following services provide targeted language processing capabilities for AI services:

- [Language](#language) provides NLP for text analysis.

  - **Use** Language when you need to work with structured or unstructured documents for the wide array of language-related tasks described in this article.

  - **Don't use** Language if you need to search documents with chat, check them for content safety, or translate them.

- [Microsoft Azure AI Translator](#translator) is a machine translation service. It can perform [real-time text translation](/azure/ai-services/translator/text-translation-overview), batch and single file [document translation](/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/overview), and [custom translations](/azure/ai-services/translator/custom-translator/overview) that you can use to incorporate specialized terminology or industry-specific language for your scenario. Translator [supports multiple languages](/azure/ai-services/translator/language-support).

  - **Use** Translator when you need to perform translation specifically. You can use other general purpose foundation language models to perform translation. But using Translator for its specialized purpose can be more effective and cost effective because of its targeted translation models.
  
  - **Don't use** Translator if you need to engage with chat, analyze content for sentiment, or moderate content. For sentiment analysis, use Language instead. For content moderation, use Microsoft Azure AI Content Safety.

- [Azure AI Document Intelligence](#document-intelligence) is a service that can convert images directly into electronic forms. You can specify expected fields and then search images that you provide to capture those fields without human intervention. Document Intelligence hosts many prebuilt models and also allows you to build custom models of your own.

  - **Use** Document Intelligence when you know exactly which fields you need to extract from scanned documents to fill electronic forms appropriately.

  - **Use** Document Intelligence to identify key structures, like headers, footers, and chapter breaks, in varied collections of documents to further programmatically interact with the document, such as in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) implementation.

  - **Don't use** Document Intelligence as a real-time search API.

### Azure OpenAI Service

[Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models. These models include O3-Mini, O1, O1-Mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and the Embeddings model series. These models are highly adaptable, which allows you to tailor them for tasks like content generation, summarization, image analysis, and semantic search. They also support natural language to code translation, which makes them versatile for various applications.
