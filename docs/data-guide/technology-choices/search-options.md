# Choose a search data store in Azure

This article compares technology choices for search data stores in Azure. A search data store is used to create and store specialized indexes for performing searches on free-form text. The text that is indexed may reside in a separate data store, such as blob storage. An application submits a query to the search data store, and the result is a list of matching documents. For more information about this scenario, see [Processing free-form text for search](../scenarios/search.yml).

## What are your options when choosing a search data store?

In Azure, all of the following data stores will meet the core requirements for search against free-form text data by providing a search index:

- [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
- [Elasticsearch](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/elastic.ec-azure-pp)
- [Azure SQL Database with full text search](/sql/relational-databases/search/full-text-search)

## Key selection criteria

For search scenarios, begin choosing the appropriate search data store for your needs by answering these questions:

- Do you want a managed service rather than managing your own servers?

- Can you specify your index schema at design time? If not, choose an option that supports updateable schemas.

- Do you need an index only for full-text search, or do you also need rapid aggregation of numeric data and other analytics? If you need functionality beyond full-text search, consider options that support additional analytics.

- Do you need a search index for Log Analytics, with support for log collection, aggregation, and visualizations on indexed data? If so, consider Elasticsearch, which is part of a Log Analytics stack.

- Do you need to index data in common document formats such as PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel? If yes, choose an option that provides document indexers.

- Does your database have specific security needs? If yes, consider the security features listed below.
