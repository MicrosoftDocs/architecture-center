# What are the machine learning products at Microsoft?

Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. By using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning solutions are built iteratively, and have distinct phases:

- Preparing data
- Experimenting and training models
- Deploying trained models
- Managing deployed models

Microsoft provides a variety of product options to prep, build, deploy, and manage your machine learning models. Compare these products and choose what you need to develop your machine learning solutions most effectively.

## Cloud-based options

The following options are available for machine learning in the Azure cloud.

## Azure Machine Learning service

[Azure Machine Learning service](/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml) is a fully managed cloud service used to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. It fully supports open-source technologies, so you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Rich tools are also available, such as [Azure notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/), [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org), or the [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/vscodetoolsforai) extension to make it easy to explore and transform data, and then train and deploy models. Azure Machine Learning service includes features that automate model generation and tuning with ease, efficiency, and accuracy.

Use Azure Machine Learning service to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models using Python and CLI at cloud scale. For a low-code or no-code option, use the interactive, [visual interface](/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-train-score) (preview) to easily and quickly build, test, and deploy models using pre-built machine learning algorithms.
