It fully supports open-source technologies, so you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Rich tools are also available, such as [Compute instances](/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance), [Jupyter notebooks](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup), or the [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code extension](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-setup-vscode-extension), a free extension that allows you to manage your resources, model training workflows and deployments in Visual Studio Code. Azure Machine Learning includes features that automate model generation and tuning with ease, efficiency, and accuracy.

Use Python SDK, Jupyter notebooks, R, and the CLI for machine learning at cloud scale. For a low-code or no-code option, use Azure Machine Learning's interactive [designer](/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) in the studio to easily and quickly build, test, and deploy models using pre-built machine learning algorithms.
