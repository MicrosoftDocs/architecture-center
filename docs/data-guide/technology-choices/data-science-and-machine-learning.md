## Azure Machine Learning

[Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml) is a fully managed cloud service used to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. It fully supports open-source technologies, so you can use tens of thousands of open-source Python packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Rich tools are also available, such as [Compute instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance), [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup), or the [Azure Machine Learning for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-setup-vscode-extension) extension to make it easy to explore and transform data, and then train and deploy models. Azure Machine Learning includes features that automate model generation and tuning with ease, efficiency, and accuracy.

Use Python SDK, Jupyter notebooks, R, and the CLI for machine learning at cloud scale. For a low-code or no-code option, use Azure Machine Learning's interactive, [designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) (preview) in studio to easily and quickly build, test, and deploy models using pre-built machine learning algorithms.

Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).
