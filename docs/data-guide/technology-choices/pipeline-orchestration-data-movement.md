# Choosing a data pipeline orchestration technology in Azure

Most big data solutions consist of repeated data processing operations, encapsulated in workflows. A pipeline orchestrator is a tool that helps to automate these workflows. An orchestrator can schedule jobs, execute workflows, and coordinate dependencies among tasks.

## What are your options for data pipeline orchestration?

In Azure, the following services and tools will meet the core requirements for pipeline orchestration, control flow, and data movement:

- [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/)
- [Oozie on HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-use-oozie-linux-mac)
- [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)](/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services)

These services and tools can be used independently from one another, or used together to create a hybrid solution. For example, the Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory V2 can natively execute SSIS packages in a managed Azure compute environment. While there is some overlap in functionality between these services, there are a few key differences.

## Key Selection Criteria

To narrow the choices, start by answering these questions:

- Do you need big data capabilities for moving and transforming your data? Usually this means multi-gigabytes to terabytes of data. If yes, then narrow your options to those that best suited for big data.

- Do you require a managed service that can operate at scale? If yes, select one of the cloud-based services that aren't limited by your local processing power.

- Are some of your data sources located on-premises? If yes, look for options that can work with both cloud and on-premises data sources or destinations.

- Is your source data stored in Blob storage on an HDFS filesystem? If so, choose an option that supports Hive queries.

## Capability matrix
