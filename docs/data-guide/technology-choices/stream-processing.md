# Choose a stream processing technology in Azure

This article compares technology choices for real-time stream processing in Azure.

Real-time stream processing consumes messages from either queue or file-based storage, processes the messages, and forwards the result to another message queue, file store, or database. Processing may include querying, filtering, and aggregating messages. Stream processing engines must be able to consume endless streams of data and produce results with minimal latency. For more information, see [Real time processing](../big-data/real-time-processing.yml).

## What are your options when choosing a technology for real-time processing?

In Azure, all of the following data stores will meet the core requirements supporting real-time processing:

- [Azure Stream Analytics](/azure/stream-analytics/)
- [HDInsight with Spark Streaming](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-streaming-overview)
- [Apache Spark in Azure Databricks](/azure/azure-databricks/)
- [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview)
- [Azure App Service WebJobs](/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs)
- [Apache Kafka streams API](/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-streams-api)

## Key Selection Criteria

For real-time processing scenarios, begin choosing the appropriate service for your needs by answering these questions:

- Do you prefer a declarative or imperative approach to authoring stream processing logic?

- Do you need built-in support for temporal processing or windowing?

- Does your data arrive in formats besides Avro, JSON, or CSV? If yes, consider options that support any format using custom code.

- Do you need to scale your processing beyond 1 GBps? If yes, consider the options that scale with the cluster size.

## Capability matrix

The following tables summarize the key differences in capabilities.
