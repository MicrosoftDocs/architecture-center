# Choosing a Microsoft cognitive services technology

Microsoft cognitive services are cloud-based APIs that you can use in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and data flows. They provide you with pretrained models that are ready to use in your application, requiring no data and no model training on your part. The cognitive services are developed by Microsoft's AI and Research team and leverage the latest deep learning algorithms. They are consumed over HTTP REST interfaces. In addition, SDKs are available for many common application development frameworks.

The cognitive services include:

- Text analysis
- Computer vision
- Video analytics
- Speech recognition and generation
- Natural language understanding
- Intelligent search

Key benefits:

- Minimal development effort for state-of-the-art AI services.
- Easy integration into apps via HTTP REST interfaces.
- Built-in support for consuming cognitive services in Azure Data Lake Analytics.

Considerations:

- Only available over the web. Internet connectivity is generally required. An exception is the Custom Vision Service, whose trained model you can export for prediction on devices and at the IoT edge.

- Although considerable customization is supported, the available services may not suit all predictive analytics requirements.

## What are your options when choosing amongst the cognitive services?

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

In Azure, there are dozens of Cognitive Services available. The current listing of these is available in a directory categorized by the functional area they support:

- [Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/)
- [Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/)
- [Decision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/decision/)
- [Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/search/)
- [Language](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/)

## Key Selection Criteria

To narrow the choices, start by answering these questions:

- What type of data are you dealing with? Narrow your options based on the type of input data you are working with. For example, if your input is text, select from the services that have an input type of text.

- Do you have the data to train a model? If yes, consider the custom services that enable you to train their underlying models with data that you provide, for improved accuracy and performance.

## Capability matrix

The following tables summarize the key differences in capabilities.
