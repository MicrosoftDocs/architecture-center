# Understand data models

Modern solutions handle diverse data, such as transactions, events, documents, telemetry, binary assets, and analytical facts. A single data store rarely satisfies all access patterns efficiently. Most production systems adopt *polyglot persistence*, which means that you select multiple storage models. This article centralizes the canonical definitions of the primary data store models available on Azure and provides comparative tables to accelerate model selection before you choose specific services.

Use the following steps to select your data models:

1. Identify workload access patterns, such as point reads, aggregations, fullâ€‘text, similarity, time-window scans, and object delivery.

1. Map patterns to the storage models in the following sections.
1. Create a shortlist of Azure services that implement those models.
1. Apply evaluation criteria, such as consistency, latency, scale, governance, and cost.
1. Combine models only where access patterns or life cycles clearly diverge.

## How to use this guide

Each model section includes a concise definition, typical workloads, data characteristics, example scenarios, and links to representative Azure services. Each section also includes a table to help you choose the right Azure service for your use case. In some cases, you can use other articles to make more informed choices about Azure service options. The respective model sections reference those articles. 

Two comparative tables summarize nonrelational model traits to help you quickly evaluate options without repeating content across sections.

## Classification overview

| Category | Primary purpose | Typical Azure service examples |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Relational (OLTP) | Consistent transactional operations | Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, or Azure Database for MySQL |
| Nonrelational, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph | Flexible schema or relationship-centric workloads | Azure Cosmos DB APIs, Azure Managed Redis, Managed Cassandra, or HBase |
| Time series | High-ingest timestamped metrics and events | Azure Data Explorer |
| Object and file | Large binary or semi-structured file storage | Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage |
| Search and indexing | Full-text and multi-field relevance, secondary indexing | Azure AI Search |
| Vector | Semantic or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) similarity | Azure AI Search or Azure Cosmos DB variants |
| Analytics, online analytical processing (OLAP), massively parallel processing (MPP) | Large-scale historical aggregation or business intelligence (BI) | Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Explorer, Azure Analysis Services, or Azure Databricks |

> [!NOTE]
> A single service might provide multiple models, also known as *multimodel*. Choose the best-fit model instead of combining models in a way that complicates operations.

## Relational data stores

Relational database management systems organize data into normalized tables by using schema-on-write. They enforce integrity and support atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) transactions and rich SQL queries.

**Strengths:** Multi-row transactional consistency, complex joins, strong relational constraints, and mature tooling for reporting, administration, and governance.

**Considerations:** Horizontal scale generally requires sharding or partitioning, and normalization can increase join cost for read-heavy denormalized views.

**Workloads:** Order management, inventory tracking, financial ledger recording, billing, and operational reporting.

### Select an Azure service for relational data stores

## Nonrelational data stores

Nonrelational databases, also called *NoSQL databases*, optimize for flexible schemas, horizontal scale, and specific access or aggregation patterns. They typically relax some aspects of relational behavior, such as schema rigidity and transaction scope, for scalability or agility.

### Document data stores <a id="document-data-stores"></a>

Use document data stores to store semi-structured documents, often in JSON format, where each document includes named fields and data. The data can be simple values or complex elements, such as lists and child collections. Per-document schema flexibility enables gradual evolution.

**Strengths:** Natural application object mapping, denormalized aggregates, multi-field indexing

**Considerations:** Document size growth, selective transactional scope, need for careful data shape design for high-scale queries

**Workloads:** Product catalogs, content management, profile stores

#### Select an Azure service for document data stores

- [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/) is a schema-less, multi-region NoSQL database that has low-latency reads and writes.

- [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/overview) is a globally distributed database that has MongoDB wire protocol compatibility and autoscaling.
- [Azure Cosmos DB in Fabric](/fabric/database/cosmos-db/overview) is a schema-less, NoSQL database that has low-latency reads and writes, simplified management, and built-in Fabric analytics.

Use the following table to help determine which Azure service meets your use case requirements.

| Service | Best for | Key features | Example use case |

### Column-family data stores <a id="columnar-data-stores"></a>

A column-family database, also known as a *wide-column database*, stores sparse data into rows and organizes dynamic columns into column families to support co-access. Column orientation improves scans over selected column sets.

**Strengths:** High write throughput, efficient retrieval of wide or sparse datasets, dynamic schema within families

**Considerations:** Up-front row key and column family design, secondary index support varies, query flexibility lower than relational

**Workloads:** Internet of Things (IoT) telemetry, personalization, analytics preaggregation, time-series style tall data when you don't use a dedicated time-series database

#### Select an Azure service for column-family data stores

- [Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra](/azure/managed-instance-apache-cassandra) is a managed service for open-source Apache Cassandra clusters.

- [Apache HBase on Azure HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-overview) is a scalable NoSQL store for big data workloads built on Apache HBase and the Hadoop ecosystem.

| [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) | High-ingest telemetry, time-series analytics | KQL, fast ad-hoc queries, time-window functions | Real-time analytics for application logs and metrics |

### Key-value data stores <a id="key/value-data-stores"></a>

A key-value data store associates each data value with a unique key. Most key-value stores only support simple query, insert, and delete operations. To modify a value either partially or completely, an application must overwrite the existing data for the entire value. In most implementations, reading or writing a single value is an atomic operation.

**Strengths:** Simplicity, low latency, linear scalability

**Considerations:** Limited query expressiveness, redesign needed for value-based lookups, large value overwrite cost

**Workloads:** Caching, sessions, feature flags, user profiles, recommendation lookups 

#### Select an Azure service for key-value data stores

Use the following table to help determine which Azure service meets your use case requirements.

| Service | Best for | Key features | Example use case |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| [Azure Managed Redis](/azure/redis/overview) | High-speed caching, session state, publish-subscribe | In-memory store, submillisecond latency, Redis protocol | Caching product pages for an e-commerce site |
| [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/azure/cosmos-db/table/overview) | Migrating existing Azure Table Storage workloads | Table Storage API compatibility | Storing user preferences and settings in a mobile app |
| [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/) | High-speed caching with massive scale and high availability | Schema-less, multi-region, autoscale | Caching, session state, serving layer |

### Graph data stores <a id="graph-data-stores"></a>

A graph database stores information as nodes and edges. Edges define relationships, and both nodes and edges can have properties similar to table columns. You can analyze connections between entities, such as employees and departments.

**Strengths:** Relationship-first querying patterns, efficient variable-depth traversals

**Considerations:** Overhead if relationships are shallow, requires careful modeling for performance, not ideal for bulk analytical scans

**Workloads:** Social networks, fraud rings, knowledge graphs, supply chain dependencies 

#### Select an Azure service for graph data stores

Use [SQL Server graph extensions](/sql/relational-databases/graphs/sql-graph-overview) for storing graph data. The graph extension extends the capabilities of SQL Server, SQL Database, and SQL Managed Instance to enable modeling and querying complex relationships by using graph structures directly within a relational database.

### Time-series data stores <a id="time-series-data-stores"></a>

Time-series data stores manage a set of values organized by time. They support features like time-based queries and aggregations and are optimized for ingesting and analyzing large volumes of data in near real time.

**Strengths:** Compression, windowed query performance, out-of-order ingestion handling  

**Considerations:** Tag cardinality management, retention cost, downsampling strategy  

**Workloads:** IoT sensor metrics, application telemetry, monitoring, industrial data  

#### Select an Azure service for time-series data stores

Use [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) for storing time-series data. Azure Data Explorer is a managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform that makes it easy to analyze high volumes of data in near real time.

### Object data stores <a id="object-data-stores"></a>

Store large binary or semi-structured objects and include metadata that rarely changes or remains immutable.

**Strengths:** Virtually unlimited scale, tiered cost, durability, parallel read capability

**Considerations:** Whole-object operations, metadata query limited, eventual listing behaviors 

**Workloads:** Media assets, backups, data lake raw zones, log archives

#### Select an Azure service for object data stores

- [Data Lake Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) is a big data-optimized object store that combines hierarchical namespace and HDFS compatibility for advanced analytics and large-scale data processing.

- [Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is a scalable object store for unstructured data like images, documents, and backups that includes tiered access for cost optimization.

Use the following table to help determine which Azure service meets your use case requirements.

|Service|Best for|Key features|Example use case|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|[Data Lake Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction)|Big data analytics and hierarchical data|HDFS, hierarchical namespace, optimized for analytics|Storing and querying petabytes of structured and unstructured data by using Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Databricks|
|[Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)|General-purpose object storage|Flat namespace, simple REST API, and tiered storage that includes hot, cool, and archive|Hosting images, documents, backups, and static website content|

### Search and indexing data stores <a id="search-engine-databases"></a>

A search engine database allows applications to search for information in external data stores. A search engine database can index massive volumes of data and provide near real-time access to these indexes.

**Strengths:** Full-text queries, scoring, linguistic analysis, fuzzy matching

**Considerations:** Eventual consistency of indexes, separate ingestion or indexing pipeline, cost of large index updates

**Workloads:** Site or product search, log search, metadata filtering, multi-attribute discovery 

#### Select an Azure service for search data stores

| Extreme low-latency key lookups or caching | Key-value |
| Wide, sparse, write-heavy telemetry | Column family or time series |
| Deep relationship traversal | Graph |
| Massive historical analytical scans | Analytics or OLAP |
| Large unstructured binaries or lake zones | Object |
| Full-text relevance and filtering | Search and indexing |
| High-ingest timestamp metrics with window queries | Time series |
| Rapid similarity (semantic or vector) | Vector search |

## Combine models and avoid pitfalls

Use more than one model when the following scenarios apply:

- Access patterns diverge, such as point lookup versus wide analytical scan versus full-text relevance.
- Life cycle and retention differ, such as immutable raw versus curated structured.
- Latency versus throughput requirements conflict.

Avoid premature fragmentation:

- Use one service when it still meets performance, scale, and governance objectives.
- Centralize shared classification logic, and avoid duplicate transformation pipelines across stores unless necessary.

Watch for the following common antipatterns:

- Multiple microservices share one database, which creates coupling.
- Teams add another model without operational maturity, such as monitoring or backups.
- A search index becomes the primary data store, which leads to misuse.

## When to re-evaluate your model choice

| Signal | Possible action |
|--------|-----------------|
| Increasing ad-hoc joins on a document store | Introduce relational read model |
| High CPU on search index because of analytical aggregations | Offload to analytics engine |
| Large denormalized documents create partial update contention | Reshape aggregates or split |
| Time-window queries slow on column-family store | Adopt purpose-built time-series database |
| Point lookup latency rises with graph traversal depth | Add derived materialized views |
