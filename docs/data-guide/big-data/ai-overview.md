# Artificial intelligence (AI)

*Artificial intelligence* (AI) is the capability of a computer to imitate intelligent human behavior. Through AI, machines can analyze images, comprehend speech, interact in natural ways, and make predictions using data.

## AI concepts

### Algorithm

An *algorithm* is a sequence of calculations and rules used to solve a problem or analyze a set of data. It is like a flow chart, with step-by-step instructions for questions to ask, but written in math and programming code. An algorithm may describe how to determine whether a pet is a cat, dog, fish, bird, or lizard. Another far more complicated algorithm may describe how to identify a written or spoken language, analyze its words, translate them into a different language, and then check the translation for accuracy.

### Machine learning

*Machine learning* (ML) is an AI technique that uses mathematical algorithms to create predictive models. An algorithm is used to parse data fields and to "learn" from that data by using patterns found within it to generate models. Those models are then used to make informed predictions or decisions about new data.

The predictive models are validated against known data, measured by performance metrics selected for specific business scenarios, and then adjusted as needed. This process of learning and validation is called *training*. Through periodic retraining, ML models are improved over time.

- [What are the machine learning products at Microsoft?](../../data-guide/technology-choices/data-science-and-machine-learning.md)

### Deep learning

*Deep learning* is a type of ML that can determine for itself whether its predictions are accurate. It also uses algorithms to analyze data, but it does so on a larger scale than ML.

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks, which consist of multiple layers of algorithms. Each layer looks at the incoming data, performs its own specialized analysis, and produces an output that other layers can understand. This output is then passed to the next layer, where a different algorithm does its own analysis, and so on.

With many layers in each neural network-and sometimes using multiple neural networks-a machine can learn through its own data processing. This requires much more data and much more computing power than ML.

- [Real-time scoring of Python scikit-learn and deep learning models on Azure](../../reference-architectures/ai/realtime-scoring-python.yml)

### Bots

A *bot* is an automated software program designed to perform a particular task.
Think of it as a robot without a body. Early bots were comparatively simple,
handling repetitive and voluminous tasks with relatively straightforward
algorithmic logic. An example would be web crawlers used by search engines to
automatically explore and catalog web content.

Bots have become much more sophisticated, using AI and other technologies
to mimic human activity and decision-making, often while interacting directly
with humans through text or even speech. Examples include bots that can take a
dinner reservation, chatbots (or conversational AI) that help with customer
service interactions, and social bots that post breaking news or scientific data
to social media sites.

Microsoft offers the Azure Bot Service, a managed service purpose-built for
enterprise-grade bot development.

    bots](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/responsible-bots/)

    bot](../../reference-architectures/ai/conversational-bot.yml)

- [Example workload: Conversational chatbot for hotel reservations on
    Azure](../../example-scenario/ai/commerce-chatbot.yml)

### Autonomous systems

*Autonomous systems* are part of an evolving new class that goes beyond basic automation. Instead of performing a specific task repeatedly with little or no variation (like bots do), autonomous systems bring intelligence to machines so they can adapt to changing environments to accomplish a desired goal.

Smart buildings use autonomous systems to automatically control operations like lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, and security. A more sophisticated example would be a self-directed robot exploring a collapsed mine shaft to thoroughly map its interior, determine which portions are structurally sound, analyze the air for breathability, and detect signs of trapped miners in need of rescue-all without a human monitoring in real time on the remote end.

## High-level architectural types

### Prebuilt AI

*Prebuilt AI* is exactly what it sounds like-off-the-shelf AI models, services,
and APIs that are ready to use. These help you add intelligence to apps,
websites, and flows without having to gather data and then build, train, and
publish your own models.

One example of prebuilt AI might be a pretrained model that can be incorporated
as is or used to provide a baseline for further custom training. Another example
would be a cloud-based API service that can be called at will to process natural
language in a desired fashion.

#### Azure Cognitive Services

[Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)
provide developers the opportunity to use prebuilt APIs and integration toolkits
to create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to
reason. The catalog of services within Cognitive Services can be categorized
into five main pillars: Vision, Speech, Language, Web Search, and
Decision/Recommendation.

    Azure](../../data-guide/technology-choices/natural-language-processing.md)

#### Prebuilt AI models in AI Builder

AI Builder is a new capability in [Microsoft Power
Platform](/power-platform/) that provides a
point-and-click interface for adding AI to your apps, even if you have no coding
or data science skills. (Some features in AI Builder have not yet released for
general availability and remain in preview status. For more information, refer
to the [Feature availability by
region](/ai-builder/availability-region) page.)

You can build and train your own models, but AI Builder also provides [select
prebuilt AI
models](/ai-builder/prebuilt-overview) that are
ready for use right away. For example, you can add a component in Microsoft
Power Apps based on a prebuilt model that recognizes contact information from
business cards.

### Custom AI

Although prebuilt AI is useful (and increasingly flexible), the best way to get
what you need from AI is probably to build a system yourself. This is obviously
a very deep and complex subject, but let's look at some basic concepts beyond
what we've just covered.

#### Code languages

The core concept of AI is the use of algorithms to analyze data and generate
models to describe (or *score*) it in ways that are useful. Algorithms are
written by developers and data scientists (and sometimes by other algorithms)
using programming code. Two of the most popular programming languages for AI
development are currently Python and R.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose, high-level programming
language. It has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability.
There is no compiling step. Python has a large standard library, but it also
supports the ability to add modules and packages. This encourages modularity and
lets you expand capabilities when needed. There is a large and growing ecosystem
of AI and ML libraries for Python, including many that are readily available in
Azure.

    library also used for ML applications and neural networks

- [Tutorial: Apply machine learning models in Azure Functions with Python and
    TensorFlow](/azure/azure-functions/functions-machine-learning-tensorflow?tabs=bash)

[R is a language and environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical
computing and graphics. It can be used for everything from mapping broad social
and marketing trends online to developing financial and climate models.

Microsoft has fully embraced the R programming language and provides many
different options for R developers to run their code in Azure.

    Learning](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-r-experiment)

#### Training

Training is core to machine learning. It is the iterative process of "teaching"
an algorithm to create models, which are used to analyze data and then make
accurate predictions from it. In practice, this process has three general
phases: training, validation, and testing.

During the training phase, a quality set of known data is tagged so that
individual fields are identifiable. The tagged data is fed to an algorithm
configured to make a particular prediction. When finished, the algorithm outputs
a model that describes the patterns it found as a set of parameters. During
validation, fresh data is tagged and used to test the model. The algorithm is
adjusted as needed and possibly put through more training. Finally, the testing
phase uses real-world data without any tags or preselected targets. Assuming the
model's results are accurate, it is considered ready for use and can be
deployed.

- [Train models with Azure Machine
    Learning](/azure/machine-learning/concept-train-machine-learning-model)

##### Hyperparameter tuning

*Hyperparameters* are data variables that govern the training process itself.
They are configuration variables that control how the algorithm operates.
Hyperparameters are thus typically set before model training begins and are not
modified within the training process in the way that parameters are.
Hyperparameter tuning involves running trials within the training task,
assessing how well they are getting the job done, and then adjusting as needed.
This process generates multiple models, each trained using different families of
hyperparameters.

- [Tune hyperparameters for your model with Azure Machine
    Learning](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters)

- [Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic): Tune Model
    Hyperparameters](/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/tune-model-hyperparameters)

##### Model selection

The process of training and hyperparameter tuning produces numerous candidate
models. These can have many different variances, including the effort needed to
prepare the data, the flexibility of the model, the amount of processing time,
and of course the degree of accuracy of its results. Choosing the best trained
model for your needs and constraints is called *model selectio*n, but this is as
much about preplanning before training as it is about choosing the one that
works best.

##### Automated machine learning (AutoML)

*Automated machine learning*, also known as AutoML, is the process of automating
the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It
can significantly reduce the time it takes to get production-ready ML models.
Automated ML can assist with model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model
training, and other tasks, without requiring extensive programming or domain
knowledge.

- [What is automated machine
    learning?](/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml)

#### Scoring

*Scoring* is also called *prediction* and is the process of generating values
based on a trained machine learning model, given some new input data. The
values, or scores, that are created can represent predictions of future values,
but they might also represent a likely category or outcome. The scoring process
can generate many different types of values:

- A list of recommended items and a similarity score

- Numeric values, for time series models and regression models

- A probability value, indicating the likelihood that a new input belongs to
    some existing category

- The name of a category or cluster to which a new item is most similar

- A predicted class or outcome, for classification models

***Batch scoring*** is when data is collected during some fixed period of time and
then processed in a batch. This might include generating business reports or
analyzing customer loyalty.

***Real-time scoring*** is exactly that-scoring that is ongoing and performed as
quickly as possible. The classic example is credit card fraud detection, but
real-time scoring can also be used in speech recognition, medical diagnoses,
market analyses, and many other applications.
