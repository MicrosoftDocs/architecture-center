This article provides an overview of the Azure database solutions described in Azure Architecture Center.

Azure Database solutions include both traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) and big data solutions.

RDBMS workloads include online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP).
Data from multiple sources in the organization can be consolidated into a data warehouse.
You can use an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to move and transform the source data.

A big data architecture is designed to handle the ingestion, processing, and analysis of large or complex data.
Big data solutions typically involve a large amount of non-relational data, which traditional RDBMS systems aren't well suited to store.
This type of database is referred to as *NoSQL* (not only SQL).

This article provides resources to learn about Azure databases. It outlines paths to implement the architectures that meet your needs, and best practices to keep in mind as you design your solutions.

There are many architectures for you to draw from to address your database needs.
We also provide solution ideas for you to build on, which include links to all the components you need.

## Learn about databases on Azure

If you're new to databases on Azure, the best place to start is Microsoft Learn.
On this free online training platform, you'll find videos and tutorials that offer hands-on learning.
Microsoft Learn offers learning paths that are based on your job role, such as developer or data analyst.

[You can browse Azure data modules](/learn/browse/?products=azure&terms=database) or use this learning path to understand [Azure SQL fundamentals](/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals).

Here are some Learn modules you might find useful:

- [Choose a data storage approach in Azure](/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure)
- [Design your migration to Azure](/learn/modules/design-your-migration-to-azure)
- [Deploy Azure SQL Database](/learn/modules/deploy-azure-sql-database)
- [Explore Azure database and analytics services](/learn/modules/azure-database-fundamentals)
- [Secure your Azure SQL Database](/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database)

## Path to production

To find options helpful for dealing with relational data, consider these resources:

- To learn about resources for gathering data from multiple sources and how to and apply data transformations within the data pipeline, see [Extract, transform, and load (ETL)](../data-guide/relational-data/etl.yml).
- To learn about Online analytical processing (OLAP), which organizes large business databases and supports complex analysis, see [Online analytical processing](../data-guide/relational-data/online-analytical-processing.yml).
- Online transaction processing systems record business interactions as they occur. For more information, see [Online transaction processing (OLTP)](../data-guide/relational-data/online-transaction-processing.md).

A *non-relational database* doesn't use the tabular schema of rows and columns. For more information, see [Non-relational data and NoSQL](../data-guide/big-data/non-relational-data.yml).

To learn about data lakes, which hold a large amount of data in its native, raw format, see [Data lakes](../data-guide/scenarios/data-lake.md).

A big data architecture can handle ingestion, processing, and analysis of data that is too large or too complex for traditional database systems.

- For more information, see [Big data architectures](../data-guide/big-data/index.yml).
- To learn about designing a system that scales well as data grows, see [Build a scalable system for massive data](../data-guide/scenarios/build-scalable-database-solutions-azure-services.md).
- To learn more about Azure Databricks, an Apache Sparkâ€“based analytics service for big data analytics and AI solutions, see [Monitoring Azure Databricks](../databricks-monitoring/index.md).

A hybrid cloud is an IT environment that combines public cloud and on-premises datacenters. For more information, see [Extend on-premises data solutions to the cloud](../data-guide/scenarios/hybrid-on-premises-and-cloud.md).

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB resource model](/azure/cosmos-db/account-databases-containers-items).

To learn about the options for transferring data to and from Azure, see [Transfer data to and from Azure](../data-guide/scenarios/data-transfer.md).
