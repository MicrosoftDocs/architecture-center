When this switch is used in combination with `appGatewaySslCertPath` and `appGatewaySslCertPwd`, it will enable a custom certificate on the AppGateway. You want to pass a custom certificate, please have the .pfx certificate file. The following process can be used to create the correct file. |  

1.  Review the instructions on [creating a website SSL
    certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-configure-ssl-certificate).

2.  Retrieve your private key. This file will have a name structure such as
    `www.contosowebstore.com\_private\_key.key`

## Optional Parameters

> -customHostName

Specifies a custom domain for the deployment. To be able to connect to the website, it is required that you provide a custom domain name, such as contoso.com. This is enabled by using the '-customHostName' switch on step2. [Details to purchase, and enable a custom domain.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/custom-dns-web-site-buydomains-web-app)
A custom domain name is not required to successfully deploy the solution for it to run, however you will not be able to connect to the website for demonstration purposes.
If this parameter is used you will be required to update the applications IP address with your DNS hosting provider (custom domain name)

#### Update DNS setting with Application Gateway IP

In the  example, the customerâ€™s DNS settings require the Application
Gateway IP address to be updated as a DNS record on the hosting site.

1.  Collect the Application Gateway IP address using the following PowerShell
    command:

```powershell
   Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress | where {$_.Name -eq "publicIp-AppGateway"} |select IpAddress
```


This command will return the IP address. For example:

>` IpAddress`  
>` ---------`
>` 52.168.0.1`

1.  Log into your DNS hosting provider and update the A/AAAA record
    with the Application Gateway IP address.


> -enableADDomainPasswordPolicy

When enabled all users in the solution will have a forced password expire duration of 60 days.
