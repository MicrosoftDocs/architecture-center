### Components of this solution

-   **Reference architecture**. The reference architecture provides the design that was used for the Contoso webstore solution.
-   **Azure Resource Manager templates**. In this deployment, JavaScript Object Notation (.JSON) files provide Microsoft Azure the ability to automatically deploy the components of the reference architecture after the configuration parameters are provided during setup.
-   **PowerShell scripts**. The scripts created by [Avyan Consulting Corp](www.avyanconsulting.com/azureservices) solution help set up the end-to-end solution. The scripts consist of:
    -   Module installation script that will install required PowerShell modules for
    the installation. This script will require local administrator rights.
    -   Global administrator setup script establishes the needed admin user to
    deploy the solution
    -   A pre-installation process that establishes user roles and establishes
    required parameters in Microsoft Active Directory to ensure the correct
    role-based access control mechanisms are deployed. This process includes
    configuring separation of duties for core administrators and users.
    -   A post-installation process that deploys an a web front-end
    runtime, and SQL backpack](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-sql-security-sample) built by the Microsoft SQL team, and revised for this scenario by Avyan Consulting Corp. The Contoso webstore Demo Application provides the framework for the solution user scenario. The templates and scripts build out a web application and SQL database that use the App Service Environment to provide service isolation     from the front end to the back end. The script also establishes a means to manage changes in the environment by creating a dev/test environment. For additional details about the reference architecture, data flow, and configuration, see Section 6 of this document.

## USER SCENARIO


> This scenario illustrates how a fictitious webstore moved their payment card processing to a pure cloud based payment processing using Azure services. 




A small webstore called, Contoso webstore is ready to move their payment system to the cloud. They have selected Microsoft Azure to host the
 process for purchasing and to allow a  clerk to collect credit card payments from their customer.

The administrator is looking for a solution can be quickly deployable to achieve his goals. He will use this proof-of-concept (POC) to understand how Azure can be used to accomplish the following:

-   Collect, store, and retrieve payment card data while complying with
    stringent Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)
    requirements

Because this is a POC that installs the required elements to operate a service,
it is not a customer ready-to-go solution. It requires careful understanding of
all the regulations and laws that your organization must abide by.

*You will be responsible for conducting appropriate security and compliance reviews of any
solution built with the architecture used by this POC, as requirements may vary
based on the specifics of your implementation and geography.Â PCI DSS requires
that you work directly with an accredited Qualified Security Assessor to certify
your production ready solution.*

### The contosowebstore POC

The POC solution is designed with the following fictitious employees of `contosowebstore.com`:

Two user roles are used only to illustrate use case, and provide insight into the user interface, and two service backend users are created durring the installation of this solution.
