# Azure Blueprint - Payment processing solution for PCI DSS enablement 

### PUBLIC PREVIEW BETA 1



## Description
  


The Azure blueprint solution is intended to simplify azure adoption, showcase commonly used reference architecture, and teach how to deploy a secure and compliant PaaS solution for customer considering the complexities of storing sensitive payment card related data. 
The solution joint developed with Avyan consulting (Microsoft MVP partner) was designed to illustrate an end to end solution that can satisfy the needs in organizations that maybe looking for a cloud solution to reduce the burden, or cost of deployment.
This solution enables the ability to:

-	Collect, store, and retrieve payment card data while complying with stringent Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standards (PCI DSS 3.2) requirements.

This solution illustrates the management of credit card data including card number, expiration, CVC (Card Verification Check) numbers securely in a four-tier secure and compliant solution could be deployed as an end-to-end Azure solution.

### Components of this solution

-   **Reference architecture**. The reference architecture provides the design that was used for the Contoso webstore solution.
-   **Azure Resource Manager templates**. In this deployment, JavaScript Object Notation (.JSON) files provide Microsoft Azure the ability to automatically deploy the components of the reference architecture after the configuration parameters are provided during setup.
-   **PowerShell scripts**. The scripts created by [Avyan Consulting Corp](http://www.avyanconsulting.com/azureservices) solution help set up the end-to-end solution. The scripts consist of:
    -   Module installation, and Global administrator setup script script will install and verify that required PowerShell modules, and Global adminisitrator are configured correctly.
    -   A installation PowerSHell script that deploys the end to end solution. that includes the components built (https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-sql-security-sample) built by the Microsoft SQL team. 

	
## DEPLOYING THE SOLUTION

The deployment of this sample requires few steps that all can be run using Microsoft PowerShell v5. To be able to connect to the website, it is required that you provide a custom domain name, such as contoso.com. This is enabled by using the '-customHostName' switch on step2. [Details to purchase, and enable a custom domain.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/custom-dns-web-site-buydomains-web-app)
A custom domain name is not required to successfully deploy the solution for it to run, however you will not be able to connect to the website for demonstration purposes.

It is also highly advised that a clean installation of PowerShell be used to deploy the solution, or an understanding how to verify that your are running the latest modules required for the scripts to run correctly. For our example we use a Windows 10 VM that we log into, and run the following commands (note we are enabling the custom domain command)

1. Install the required modules, and set up the administrator roles correctly.
```powershell
 .\0-Setup-AdministrativeAccountAndPermission.ps1 
-azureADDomainName contosowebstore.onmicrosoft.com
-tenantId XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
-subscriptionId XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
-configureGlobalAdmin 
-installModules
 ```

## USER SCENARIO

The Payment processing solution for PCI DSS 3.2 enablement will address the following use case -

> This scenario illustrates how a fictitious webstore moved their payment card processing to a cloud based payment processing using Azure services, the solution addresses the collection of basic user information, and their payment information. The solution does not process, or resolve the purchase of the card holder data (CHD) 



### Use Case
A small webstore called, 'Contoso webstore' is ready to move their payment system to the cloud. They have selected Microsoft Azure to host the process for purchasing and to allow a  clerk to collect credit card payments from their customer.

The administrator is looking for a solution that can be quickly deployable to achieve his goals in illustrating a cloud born solution. He will use this proof-of-concept (POC) to discuss with his stakeholders how Azure can be used to accomplish:

-   Collect, store, and retrieve payment card data while complying with stringent Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) requirements


> You will be responsible for conducting appropriate security and compliance reviews of any
solution built with the architecture used by this POC, as requirements may vary
based on the specifics of your implementation and geography.Â PCI DSS requires
that you work directly with an accredited Qualified Security Assessor to certify
your production ready solution.
