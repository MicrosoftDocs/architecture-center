# Adopting Microsoft Azure: digital transformation example

In the [organizational readiness](), you learned about digitally transforming an Enterprise's business by adopting cloud technologies. You also learned that the high-level process for preparing the organization for digital transformation is:

1. Identify the stakeholders in your organization participating in the cloud adoption process. 
2. Conduct regular discussions with the stakeholders.
  * Capture stakeholder concerns. 
  * Identify the potential gaps in skills, roles, and processes from these concerns. 
  * Partner across teams on the overall goals of cloud adoption for the organization. 
3. Create a plan to address gaps and concerns. Execute the plan. 
4. Repeat this process until all gaps and concerns have been addressed.

To help you better understand how this process works, let's take a look at an example.

## Example: identify stakeholders

Every organization is unique and has a distinct organizational structure. However, there is a set of common roles with an associated set of activities they perform. Generally, these roles are:

| Area | Activities |
|-----|-----|
| Senior Leadership | Creating the top-down business case for the Enterprise's digital transformation. Identifying the business units that will be key players in the digital transformation, and enumerating the high-level blockers and issues for each. Drives decision-making and clears path forward during execution phase of the digital transformation. |
| Business unit owners| Executive-level ownership of functional business units. Typical business units are Finance, Legal/Human Resources, IT, and Technology. Business unit owners are responsible for identifying and empowering the individuals in their organization that participate in the digital transformation.|
|Finance | Owner of the financial commitment of the digital transformation, responsible for developing policies and procedures for tracking resource consumption costs including billing and chargeback.|
|IT |  Responsible for governing the Enterprise's cloud resources. This includes extending the on-premises network to include cloud infrastructure, resource management and access, and workload health and monitoring. | 
|Human resources| People management. |
|Compliance/Security | Responsible for protecting business assets on both the regulatory and security fronts. Addresses customer security and compliance requirements, including information access management, encryptions, audits, compliance, and controls. |
|Program management | Responsible for scoping, planning, and executing all digital transformation activities. Program management works across teams to keep digital transformation tasks on track, and raise business and technical blocking issues to senior leadership for unblocking. |
|Engineering|All development roles involved in the digital transformation, including developers, testers, and build engineers.|

In our example, the identification of stakeholders begins at the Senior leadership level. Senior leadership identifies the business unit owners that manage areas directly involved in the digital transformation. Each business unit owner selects individuals to represent the organization's interests at the regular discussions. These individuals are the stakeholders and assume ownership of their organization's participation in the digital transformation.

## Example: conduct regular planning discussions

Each stakeholder is responsible for communicating with their organization to discover the concerns associated with the digital transformation. For example, individuals that work on the physical infrastructure of the on-premises datacenter may be concerned that their job function is no longer required in the cloud. In another example, individuals working in compliance and security may be concerned that engineering organizations are too easily able to deploy cloud infrastructure that does not meet the regularity and security requirements of the Enterprise.

Each stakeholder collects these concerns and brings them to the regular digital transformation planning meeting. These concerns are discussed, and through the discussion any gaps in roles, skills, or process are identified. For example, the individuals working on the physical infrastructure are concerned that their job function is no longer required for cloud infrastructure, and this represents a gap in skills. While the stated concern is job security, the actual concern is a lack of skills.

Another aspect of these discussions is identifying partnerships across teams. Some concerns and their resulting gaps in roles, skills, or process may not be constrained to a single business unit. Some processes may also require individuals from multiple business units to coordinate. 

## Example: create a plan to address gaps

For each gap in roles, skills, or process, a plan to address the gap is created. For example, the concern of the security stakeholder around deployment of non-compliant resources requires a process that includes both the compliance/security team and the IT team. The security/compliance team drafts the specification for compliant resource configurations and the IT team creates the scripts and templates that restrict the deployment to just those configurations. The next step is to execute the plan. The security/compliance team drafts the specification, and the IT team implements the scripts and templates that are used to lock down the Enterprise's use of cloud resources.

## Next Steps

Your Enterprise's digital transformation is an iterative process, and there will be many cycles of this process until all concerns are addressed.
