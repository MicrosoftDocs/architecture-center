# Contoso migration:  Refactor a Team Foundation Server deployment to Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

This article shows how Contoso are refactoring their on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) deployment by migrating it to Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) in Azure. Contoso's development team have used TFS for team collaboration and source control for the past five years. Now, they want to move to a cloud-based solution for dev and test work, and for source control. VSTS will play a role as they move to a DevOps model, and develop new cloud-native apps.

This document is the eleventh in a series of articles that show how the fictitious company Contoso migrates its on-premises resources to the Microsoft Azure cloud. The series includes background information, and scenarios that illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure, and run different types of migrations. Scenarios grow in complexity, and we'll add additional articles over time.

## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with their business to identify future goals. Business partners aren't overly concerned with dev tools and technologies, but they have captured these points:

- **Software**: Regardless of the core business, all companies are now software companies, including Contoso. Business leadership is interested in how IT can help lead the company with new working practices for users, and experiences for their customers.
- **Efficiency**: Contoso needs to streamline process and remove unnecessary procedures for developers and users. This will allow them to deliver on customer requirements more efficiently. The business needs IT to fast, without wasting time or money.
- **Agility**:  Contoso IT needs to respond to business needs, and react more quickly than the marketplace to enable success in a global economy. IT mustn't be a blocker for the business.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for the migration to VSTS:

- They need a tool to migrate the data to the cloud. Few manual processes should be needed.
- Work item data and history for the last year must be migrated.
- They don't want to set up new user names and passwords. All current system assignments must be maintained.
- They want to move away from Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) to Git for source control.
- The cutover to Git will be a "tip migration" that imports only the latest version of the source code. It will happen during a downtime when all work will be halted as the codebase shifts. They understand that only the current master branch history will be available after the move.
- They're concerned about the change and want to test it before doing a full move. They want to retain access to TFS even after the move to VSTS.
- They have multiple collections, and want to start with one that has only a few projects to better understand the process.
- They understand that TFS collections are a one-to-one relationship with VSTS accounts, so they'll have multiple URLs. However, this matches their current model of separation for code bases and projects.


## Proposed architecture

- Contoso will move their TFS projects to the cloud, and no longer host their projects or source control on-premises.
- TFS will be migrated to VSTS.
- Currently Contoso has one TFS collection named **ContosoDev**, which will be migrated to a VSTS account called **contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com**.
- The projects, work items, bugs and iterations from the last year will be migrated to VSTS.
- Contoso will leverage their Azure Active Directory, which they set up when they [deployed their Azure infrastructure](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) at the beginning of their migration planning. 


![Scenario architecture](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/architecture.png) 


## Migration process

Contoso will complete the migration process as follows:

1. There's a lot of  preparation involved. As a first step, Contoso needs to upgrade their TFS implementation to a supported level. They're currently running TFS 2017 Update 3, but to use database migration they need to run a supported 2018 version with the latest updates.
2. After upgrading, they'll run the TFS migration tool, and validate their collection.
3. They'll build a set of preparation file, and perform a migration dry run for testing.
4. They'll then run another migration, this time a full migration that includes work items, bugs, sprints, and code.
5. AFter the migration, they'll move their code from TFVC to Git.

![Migration process](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migration-process.png) 


## Scenario steps

Here's how Azure will complete the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Step 1: Create an Azure storage account**: This storage account will be used during the migration process.
> * **Step 2: Upgrade TFS**: They'll upgrade their deployment to TFS 2018 Upgrade 2. 
> * **Step 3: Validate collection**: They'll validate their TFS collection in preparation for migration.
> * **Step 4: Build preparation file**: They'll create the migration files using the TFS Migration Tool. 


## Step 1: Create a storage account

1. In the Azure portal, Contoso creates a storage account (**contosodevmigration**).
2. They place the account in their secondary region they use for failover - Central US. They use a general-purpose standard account with locally-redudant storage.

    ![Storage account](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/storage1.png)

- [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account).


## Step 2: Upgrade TFS

Contoso upgrades their TFS server to TFS 2018 Update 2. Before they start:

- They download [TFS 2018 Update 2](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- They verify the [hardware requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/tfs/server/requirements), and read through the [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releasenotes/tfs2018-relnotes) and [upgrade gotchas](https://docs.microsoft.com/tfs/server/upgrade/get-started#before-you-upgrade-to-tfs-2018).

They upgrade as follows:

1. To start, they back up their TFS server (running on a VMware vM) and take a VMware snapshot.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade1.png) 

2. The TFS installer starts, and they choose the install location. The installer needs internet access.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade2.png) 

3. After the installation finishes, the Server Configuration Wizard starts.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade3.png) 

4. After verification, the Wizard completes the upgrade.

     ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade4.png) 

5. Contoso verifies the TFS installation by reviewing projects, work items, and code.

     ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/upgrade5.png) 

> [!NOTE]
> Some TFS upgrades need to run the Configure Features Wizard after the upgrade completes. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/work/customize/configure-features-after-upgrade?utm_source=ms&utm_medium=guide&utm_campaign=vstsdataimportguide&view=vsts).

**Need more help?**

Learn about [upgrading TFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/tfs/server/upgrade/get-started).

## Step 3: Validate the TFS collection

Contoso runs the TFS Migration Tool against the ContosoDev collection database to validate it before migration.

1. Contoso downloads and unzips the [TFS Migration Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54274). It's important to download the version for the TFS update that's running. The version can be checked in the admin console.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection1.png)

2. They run the tool to perform the validation, by specifying the URL of the team project collection:

        **TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev**


3. The tool shows an error.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection2.png)

5. They located the log files are located in the **Logs** folder, just before the tool location. A log file is generated for each major validation. **TfsMigration.log** holds the main information.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection3.png)

4. Contoso finds this entry, related to identity.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection4.png)

5. Contoso runs **TfsMigration validate /help** at the command line, and sees that the command **/tenantDomainName** seems to be required to validate identities.

     ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection5.png)

6. They run the validation command again, and include this value, along with their Azure AD name: **TfsMigrator validate /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com**.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection7.png)

7. An Azure AD Sign In screen appears, and they enter the credentials of a Global Admin user.

     ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection8.png)

8. The validation passes, and is confirmed by the tool.

    ![TFS](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/collection9.png)



## Step 4: Create the migration files

With the validation complete, Contoso can use the TFS Migration Tool to build the migration files.

1. They run the prepare step in the tool.

    **TfsMigrator prepare /collection:http://contosotfs:8080/tfs/ContosoDev /tenantDomainName:contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com /accountRegion:cus**

     ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep1.png)

    Prepare does the following:
    - Scans the collection to find a list of all users and populates the identify map log (**IdentityMapLog.csv**])
    - Prepares the connection to Azure Active Directory to find a match for each identity.
    - Contoso has already deployed Azure AD and synchronized it using AD Connect, so Prepare should be able to find the matching identities and mark them as Active.

2. An Azure AD Sign In screen appears, and Contoso enters the credentials of a Global Admin.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep2.png)

3. Prepare completes, and the tool reports that the import files have been generated successfully.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep3.png)

4. Contoso can now see that both the IdentityMapLog.csv and the import.json file have been created in a new folder.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep4.png)

5. The import.json file provides import settings. It includes information such as the desired account name, and storage account information. Most of the fields are populated automatically. Some fields required user input. Contoso opens the file, and adds the VSTS account name to be created: **contosodevmigration**. With this name, their VSTS URL will be **contosodevmigration.visualstudio.com**.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep5.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The account must be created before the migration, It can be changed after migration is done.

6. They review the identity log map file that shows the accounts that will be brought into VSTS during the import. 

    - Active identities refer to identities that will become users in VSTS after the import.
    - On VSTS, these identities will be licensed, and show up as a user in the account after migration.
    - These identities are marked as **Active** in the **Expected Import Status** column in the file.

    ![Prepare](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/prep6.png)



## Step 5: Migrate to VSTS

With preparation in place, Contoso can now focus on the migration. After running the migration, they'll switch from using TFVC to Git for version control.

Before they start, Contoso schedules downtime with the dev team, to take the collection offline for migration. These are the steps for the migration process:

1. **Detach the collection**: Identity data for the collection resides in the TFS server configuration database while the collection is attached and online. When a collection is detached from the TFS server, it takes a copy of that identity data, and packages it with the collection for transport. Without this data, the identity portion of the import cannot be executed. It's recommended that the collection stay detached until the import has been completed, as there's no way to import the changes which occurred during the import.
2. **Generate a backup**: The next step of the migration process is to generate a backup that can be imported into VSTS. Data-tier Application Component Packages (DACPAC), is a SQL Server feature that allows database changes to be packaged into a single file, and deployed to other instances of SQL. It can also be restored directly to VSTS, and is therefore used as the packaging method for getting collection data into the cloud. Contoso will use the SqlPackage.exe tool to generate the DACPAC. This tool is included in SQL Server Data Tools.
3. **Upload to storage**: AFter the DACPAC is created, they upload it to Azure Storage. After it's uploaded, they get a shared access signature (SAS), to allow the TFS Migration Tool access to the storage.
4. **Fill out the import**: Contoso can then fill out missing fields in the import file, including the DACPAC setting. To start with they'll specify that they want to do a **DryRun** import, to check that everything's working properly before the full migration.
5. **Do a dry run**: Dry run imports help test collection migration. Dry runs have limited life, and are deleted before a production migration runs. They're deleted automatically after a set period of time. A note about when the dry run will be deleted is included in the success email received after the import finishes. Take note and plan accordingly.
6. **Complete the production migration**: With the Dry Run migration completed, Contoso does the final migration by updating the import.json, and running import again.



### Detach the collection

Before starting, Contoso takes a local SQL Server backup, and VMware snapshot of the TFS server, before detaching.

1.  In the TFS Admin console, they select the collection they want to detach  (**ContosoDev**).

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate1.png)

2. In **General**, they select **Detach Collection**

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate2.png)

3. In the Detach Team Project Collection Wizard > **Servicing Message**, they provide a message for users who might try to connect to projects in the collection.

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate3.png)

4. In **Detach Progress**, they monitor progress and click **Next** when the process finishes.

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate4.png)

5. In **Readiness Checks**, when checks finish they click **Detach**.

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate5.png)

6. They click **Close** to finish up.

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate6.png)

6. The collection is no longer referenced in the TFS Admin console.

    ![Migrate](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/migrate7.png)


### Generate a DACPAC

Contoso creates a backup (DACPAC) for import into VSTS.

- SqlPackage.exe in SQL Server Data Tools is used to create the DACPAC. There are multiple versions of SqlPackage.exe installed with SQL Server Data Tools, located under folders with names such as 120, 130, and 140. It's important to use the right version to prepare the DACPAC.
- TFS 2018 imports need to use SqlPackage.exe from the 140 folder or higher.  For CONTOSOTFS, this file is located in folder:
**C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\140**.


Contoso generates the DACPAC as follows:

1. They open a command prompt and navigate to the SQLPackage.exe location. They type this following command to generate the DACPAC:

    **SqlPackage.exe /sourceconnectionstring:"Data Source=SQLSERVERNAME\INSTANCENAME;Initial Catalog=Tfs_ContosoDev;Integrated Security=True" /targetFile:C:\TFSMigrator\Tfs_ContosoDev.dacpac /action:extract /p:ExtractAllTableData=true /p:IgnoreUserLoginMappings=true /p:IgnorePermissions=true /p:Storage=Memory** 

    ![Backup](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup1.png)

2. The following message appears after the command runs.

    ![Backup](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup2.png)

3. They verify the properties of the DACPACfile

    ![Backup](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup3.png)

### Update the file to storage

After the DACPAC is created, Contoso uploads it to Azure Storage.

1. They [download and install](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) Azure Storage Explorer.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup5.png)

4. They connect to their subscription and locate the storage account they created for the migration (**contosodevmigration**). They create a new blob container, **vstsmigration**.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup6.png)

5. They specify the DACPAC file for upload as a block blob.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup7.png)
    
7. After the file's uploaded, they click the file name > **Generate SAS**. They expand the blob containers under the storage account, select the container with the import files, and click **Get Shared Access Signature**.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup8.png)

8. They accept the defaults and click **Create**. This enables access for 24 hours.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup9.png)

9. They copy the Shared Access Signature URL, so that it can be used by the TFS Migration Tool.

    ![Upload](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/backup10.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The migration must happen before within the allowed time window or permissions will expire.
> Don't generate an SAS key from the Azure portal. Keys generated like this are account-scoped, and won't work with the import.

### Fill in the import settings

Earlier, Contoso partially filled out the import specification file (import.json). Now, they need to add the remaining settings.

They open the import.json file, and fill out the following fields:
•	Location: Location of the SAS key that was generated above.
•	Dacpac: Set the name to the DACPAC file you uploaded to the storage account. Include the ".dacpac" extension.
•	ImportType: Set to DryRun for now.


![Import settings](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/import1.png)


### Do a dry run migration

Contoso start with a dry run migration, to make sure everything's working as expected.

1. They open a command prompt, and locate to the TfsMigration location (C:\TFSMigrator).
2. As a first step they validate the import file. They want to be sure the file is formatted properly, and that the SAS key is working.

    **TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly**

3. The validation returns an error that the SAS key needs a longer expiry time.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test1.png)

3. They use Azure Storage Explorer to create a new SAS key with expiry set to seven days.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test2.png)

3. They update the import.json file and run the validation again. This time it completes successfully.

    **TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json /validateonly**

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test3.png)
    
7. They start the dry run:

    **TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json**

8. A message is issued to confirm the migration. Note the length of time for which the staged data will be maintained after the dry run.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test4.png)

9. Azure AD Sign In appears, and should be completing with Contoso Admin sign-in.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test5.png)

10. A message shows information about the import.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test6.png)

11. After 15 minutes or so, Contoso browses to the URL, and sees the following information:

     ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test7.png)

12. After the migration finishes a Contoso Dev Leads signs into VSTS to check that the dry run worked properly. After authentication, VSTS needs a few details to confirm the account.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test8.png)

13. In VSTS, the Dev Lead can see that the projects have been migrated to VSTS. There's a notice that the account will be deleted in 15 days.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test9.png)

14. The Dev Lead opens one of the projects and opens **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This shows that work item data has been migrated, along with his identity.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test10.png)

15. He also checks other projects and code, to confirm that the source code and history has been migrated.

    ![Dry run](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/test11.png)


### Run the production migration

With the dry run complete, Contoso move on to the production migration. They delete the dry run, update the import settings, and run import again.

1. In the VSTS portal, they delete the dry run account.
2. They update the import.json file to set the **ImportType** to **ProductionRun**.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full1.png)

3. They start the migration as they did for the dry run: **TfsMigrator import /importFile:C:\TFSMigrator\import.json**.
4. A message shows to confirm the migration, and warns that data could be held in a secure location as a staging area for up to seven days.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full2.png)

5. In Azure AD Sign In, Contoso specifies a Contoso Admin sign-in.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full3.png)

6. A message shows information about the import.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full4.png)

7. After around 15 minutes, Contoso browses to the URL, and sees the following information:

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full5.png)

8. After the migration finishes a Contoso Dev Leads logs onto VSTS to check that the migration worked properly. After login, he can sees that projects have been migrated.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full6.png)

8. The Dev Lead opens one of the projects and opens **Work Items** > **Assigned to me**. This shows that work item data has been migrated, along with his identity.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full7.png)

9. He checks other work item data to confirm.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full8.png)

15. He also checks other projects and code, to confirm that the source code and history has been migrated.

    ![Production](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/full9.png)


### Move source control from TFVC to GIT

With migration complete, Contoso wants to move from TFVC to Git for source code management. They need to import the source code currently in their VSTS account as Git repos in the same account.

1. In the VSTS portal, they open one of the TFVC repos (**$/PolicyConnect**) and review it.

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git1.png)

2. They click the **Source** dropdown > **Import**.

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git2.png)

3. In **Source type** they select **TFVC**, and specify the path to the repo. They've decided not to migrate the history.

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git3.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Due to differences in how TFVC and Git store version control information, we recommend not to migrate your history. This is the   approach that Microsoft took when it migrated Windows and other products from centralized version control to Git.

4. After the import, Contoso reviews the code.

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git4.png)

5. They repeat the process for the second repository (**$/SmartHotelContainer**).

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git5.png)

6. After reviewing the source, the Dev Leads agree that the migration to VSTS is done. VSTS now becomes the source for all development within teams involved in the migration.

    ![Git](./media/contoso-migration-tfs-vsts/git6.png)



**Need more help?**

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/git/import-from-tfvc?view=vsts) about importing from TFVC.

##  Clean up after migration

With migration complete, Contoso needs to do the following:

- Review the [post-import](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/articles/migration-post-import?view=vsts) article for information about additional import activities.
