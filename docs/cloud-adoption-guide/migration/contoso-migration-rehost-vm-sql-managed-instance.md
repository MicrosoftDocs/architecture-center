## On-premises architecture


This diagram shows the current Contoso on-premises infrastructure:

![Current Contoso architecture](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/contoso-architecture.png)  

- Contoso has one main datacenter. The datacenter is located in the city of New York in the Eastern United States.
- Contoso has three additional local branches across the United States.
- The main datacenter is connected to the internet with a fiber Metro Ethernet connection (500 MBps).
- Each branch is connected locally to the internet by using business-class connections with IPsec VPN tunnels back to the main datacenter. The setup allows Contoso's entire network to be permanently connected and optimizes internet connectivity.
- The main datacenter is fully virtualized with VMware. Contoso has two ESXi 6.5 virtualization hosts that are managed by vCenter Server 6.5.
- Contoso uses Active Directory for identity management. Contoso uses DNS servers on the internal network.
- The domain controllers in the datacenter run on VMware VMs. The domain controllers at local branches run on physical servers.

## Business drivers

Contoso's IT leadership team has worked closely with the company's business partners to understand what the business wants to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth**: Contoso is growing. As a result, pressure has increased on the company's on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Increase efficiency**: Contoso needs to remove unnecessary procedures, and to streamline processes for its developers and users. The business needs IT to be fast and to not waste time or money, so the company can deliver faster on customer requirements.
- **Increase agility**:  Contoso IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react faster than the changes that occur in the marketplace for the company to be successful in a global economy. IT at Contoso must not get in the way or become a business blocker.
- **Scale**: As the company's business grows successfully, Contoso IT must provide systems that can grow at the same pace.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has identified goals for this migration. The company uses migration goals to determine the best migration method.

- After migration, the app in Azure should have the same performance capabilities that the app has today in Contoso's on-premises VMWare environment. Moving to the cloud doesn't mean that app performance is less critical.
- Contoso doesnâ€™t want to invest in the app. The app is critical and important to the business, but Contoso simply wants to move the app in its current form to the cloud.
- Database administration tasks should be minimized after the app is migrated.
- Contoso doesn't want to use an Azure SQL Database for this app. It's looking for alternatives.

## Proposed architecture

In this scenario:

- Contoso wants to migrate its two-tier on-premises travel app.
- The app is tiered across two VMs (**WEBVM** and **SQLVM**) and is located on a VMware ESXi version 6.5 host (**contosohost1.contoso.com**). 
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**) running on a VM.
- Contoso migrates the app database (**SmartHotelDB**) to an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.
- Contoso migrates the on-premises VMware VMs to an Azure VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (**contoso-datacenter**) and an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned when the migration is finished.

[Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/) | The Site Recovery service orchestrates and manages migration and disaster recovery for Azure VMs and on-premises VMs and physical servers.  | During replication to Azure, Azure Storage charges are incurred.  Azure VMs are created and incur charges when failover occurs. Learn more about [Site Recovery charges and pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/).

 ## Migration process

Contoso will migrate the web and data tiers of its SmartHotel app to Azure by completing these steps:

1. Contoso already has its Azure infrastructure in place, so it just needs to add a couple of specific Azure components for this scenario.
2. The data tier will be migrated by using the Data Migration Service. The Data Migration Service connects to the on-premises SQL Server VM across a site-to-site VPN connection between the Contoso datacenter and Azure. Then, the Data Migration Service migrates the database.
3. The web tier will be migrated by using a lift-and-shift migration by using Site Recovery. The process entails preparing the on-premises VMware environment, setting up and enabling replication, and migrating the VMs by failing them over to Azure.

     ![Migration architecture](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/migration-architecture.png) 

## Prerequisites

Contoso and other users must meet the following prerequisites for this scenario:

Requirements | Details
--- | ---
**Enroll in the Managed Instance preview** | You must be enrolled in the SQL Database Managed Instance limited public preview. You need an Azure subscription to [sign up](https://portal.azure.com#create/Microsoft.SQLManagedInstance). Signup can take a few days to complete, so make sure to sign up before you begin to deploy this scenario.
**Azure subscription** | You should have already created a subscription when you perform the assessment in the first article in this series. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).<br/><br/> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions.<br/><br/> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator of the subscription, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.<br/><br/> If you need more granular permissions, see [Use role-based access control to manage Site Recovery access](../site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control.md). 
**Site Recovery (on-premises)** | Your on-premises vCenter Server instance should be running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5<br/><br/> An ESXi host running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5<br/><br/> One or more VMware VMs running on the ESXi host.<br/><br/> VMs must meet [Azure requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#azure-vm-requirements).<br/><br/> Supported [network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#network) and [storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#storage) configuration.
**Database Migration Service** | For the Database Migration Service, you need a [compatible on-premises VPN device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices).<br/><br/> You must be able to configure the on-premises VPN device. It must have an external-facing public IPv4 address. The address can't be located behind a NAT device.<br/><br/> Make sure you have access to your on-premises SQL Server database.<br/><br/> Windows Firewall should be able to access the source database engine. Learn how to [configure Windows Firewall for Database Engine access](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).<br/><br/> If there's a firewall in front of your database machine, add rules to allow access to the database and files via SMB port 445.<br/><br/> The credentials that are used to connect to the source SQL Server instance and which target Managed Instance must be members of the sysadmin server role.<br/><br/> You need a network share in your on-premises database that the Database Migration Service can use to back up the source database.<br/><br/> Make sure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write permissions on the network share.<br/><br/> Make a note of a Windows user and password that has full control permissions on the network share. The Database Migration Service impersonates these user credentials to upload backup files to the Azure Storage container.<br/><br/> The SQL Server Express installation process sets the TCP/IP protocol to **Disabled** by default. Make sure that it's enabled.

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso plans to set up the deployment:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Step 1: Set up a SQL Database Managed Instance**: Contoso needs a pre-created Managed Instance to which the on-premises SQL Server database will migrate.
> * **Step 2: Prepare the Database Migration Service**: Contoso must register the database migration provider, create an instance, and then create a Database Migration Service project. Contoso also must set up a shared access signature (SAS) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the Database Migration Service. An SAS URI provides delegated access to resources in Contoso's storage account, so Contoso can grant limited permissions to storage objects. Contoso sets up an SAS URI, so the Database Migration Service can access the storage account container to which the service uploads the SQL Server backup files.
> * **Step 3: Prepare Azure for Site Recovery**: Contoso must create a storage account to hold replicated data for Site Recovery. It also must create an Azure Recovery Services vault.
> * **Step 4: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery**: Contoso will prepare accounts for VM discovery and agent installation to connect to Azure VMs after failover.
> * **Step 5: Replicate VMs**: To set up replication, Contoso configure the Site Recovery source and target environments, sets up a replication policy, and starts replicating VMs to Azure Storage.
> * **Step 6: Migrate the database by using the Database Migration Service**: Contoso migrates the database.
> * **Step 7: Migrate the VMs by using Site Recovery**: Contoso runs a test failover to make sure everything's working. Then, Contoso runs a full failover to migrate the VMs to Azure.

## Step 1: Prepare a SQL Database Managed Instance

To set up an Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Contoso needs a subnet that meets the following requirements:

- The subnet must be dedicated. It must be empty, and it can't contain any other cloud service. The subnet can't be a gateway subnet.
- After the Managed Instance is created, Contoso should not add resources to the subnet.
- The subnet can't have a network security group associated with it.
- The subnet must have a user-defined routing (UDR) route table. The only route assigned should be 0.0.0.0/0 next hop internet. 
- Optional custom DNS: If custom DNS is specified on the Azure virtual network, Azure's recursive resolvers IP address (such as 168.63.129.16) must be added to the list. Learn how to [configure custom DNS for a Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-custom-dns).
- The subnet mustn't have a service endpoint (storage or SQL) associated with it. Service endpoints should be disabled on the virtual network.
- The subnet must have a minimum of 16 IP addresses. Learn how to [size the Managed Instance subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-vnet-configuration#determine-the-size-of-subnet-for-managed-instances).
- In Contoso's hybrid environment, custom DNS settings are required. Contoso configures DNS settings to use one or more of the company's Azure DNS servers. Learn more about [DNS customization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-custom-dns).

### Set up a virtual network for the Managed Instance

Contoso sets up the virtual network as follows: 

1. Contoso creates a new virtual network (**VNET-SQLMI-EU2**) in the primary East US 2 region. It adds the virtual network to the **ContosoNetworkingRG** resource group.
2. Contoso assigns an address space of 10.235.0.0/24. Contoso ensures that the range doesn't overlap with any other networks in its enterprise.
2. Contoso adds two subnets to the network:
    - **SQLMI-DS-EUS2** (10.235.0.0.25)
    - **SQLMI-SAW-EUS2** (10.235.0.128/29). This subnet is used to attach a directory to the Managed Instance.

    ![Managed Instance - Create virtual network](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-vnet.png)

6. After the virtual network and subnets are deployed, Contoso peers networks as follows:

    - Peers **VNET-SQLMI-EUS2** with **VNET-HUB-EUS2** (the hub virtual network for the East US 2).
    - Peers **VNET-SQLMI-EUS2** with **VNET-PROD-EUS2** (the production network).

    ![Network peering](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-peering.png)

7. Contoso sets custom DNS settings. DNS points first to Contoso's Azure domain controllers. Azure DNS is secondary. The Contoso Azure domain controllers are located as follows:

    - Located in the **PROD-DC-EUS2** subnet, in the East US 2 production network (**VNET-PROD-EUS2**)
    - **CONTOSODC3** address: 10.245.42.4
    - **CONTOSODC4** address: 10.245.42.5
    - Azure DNS resolver: 168.63.129.16

- Learn how to [update Azure Active Directory DNS settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-getting-started-dns).

### Set up routing

The Managed Instance is placed in a private virtual network. Contoso needs a route table for the virtual network to communicate with the Azure Management Service. If the virtual network can't communicate with the service that manages it, the virtual network becomes inaccessible.

Contoso considers these factors:

- The route table contains a set of rules (routes) that specify how packets sent from the Managed Instance should be routed in the virtual network.
- The route table is associated with subnets in which Managed Instances are deployed. Each packet that leaves a subnet is handled based on the associated route table.
- A subnet can be associated with only one route table.
- There are no additional charges for creating route tables in Microsoft Azure.

 To set up routing:

1. Contoso creates a UDR table. Contoso creates the route table in the **ContosoNetworkingRG** resource group.

    ![Route table](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table.png)

2. To comply with Managed Instance requirements, after the route table (**MIRouteTable**) is deployed, Contoso adds a route that has an address prefix of 0.0.0.0/0. The **Next hop type** option is set to **Internet**.

    ![Route table prefix](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table-prefix.png)
    
3. Contoso associates the route table with the **SQLMI-DB-EUS2** subnet (in the **VNET-SQLMI-EUS2** network). 

    ![Route table subnet](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table-subnet.png)

Learn how to [set up routes for a Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-create-tutorial-portal#create-new-route-table-and-a-route).

### Create a Managed Instance

Now, Contoso can provision a SQL Database Managed Instance:

1. Because the Managed Instance serves a business app, Contoso deploys the Managed Instance in the company's primary East US 2 region. Contoso adds the Managed Instance to the **ContosoRG** resource group.
2. Contoso selects a pricing tier, size compute, and storage for the instance. Learn more about [Managed Instance pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/).

    ![Managed Instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-create.png)

3. After the Managed Instance is deployed, two new resources appear in the **ContosoRG** resource group:

    - A virtual cluster in case Contoso has multiple Managed Instances.
    - The SQL Server Database Managed Instance. 

    ![Managed Instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-resources.png)

*Need more help?*

Learn how to [provision a Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-create-tutorial-portal).

## Step 2: Prepare the Database Migration Service

To prepare the Database Migration Service, Contoso needs to do a few things:

- Register the Database Migration Service provider in Azure.
- Provide the Database Migration Service with access to Azure Storage for uploading the backup files that are used to migrate a database. To provide access to Azure Storage, Contoso creates an Azure Blob storage container. Contoso generates an SAS URI for the Blob storage container. 
- Create a Database Migration Service project.

Then, Contoso completes the following steps:

1. Contoso registers the database migration provider under its subscription.
    ![Database Migration Service - Register](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-subscription.png)

2. Contoso creates a Blob storage container. Contoso generates an SAS URI so that the Database Migration Service can access it.

    ![Database Migration Service - Generate an SAS URI](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-sas.png)

3. Contoso creates a Database Migration Service instance. 

    ![Database Migration Service - Create instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-instance.png)

4. Contoso places the Database Migration Service instance in the **PROD-DC-EUS2** subnet of the **VNET-PROD-DC-EUS2** virtual network.
    - Contoso places the Database Migration Service there because the service must be in a virtual network that can access the on-premises SQL Server VM via a VPN gateway.
    - The **VNET-PROD-EUS2** is peered to **VNET-HUB-EUS2** and is allowed to use remote gateways. The **Use remote gateways** option ensures that the Database Migration Service can communicate as required.

- Learn how to [create and use SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2).


## Step 3: Prepare Azure for the Site Recovery service

Several Azure elements are required for Contoso to set up Site Recovery for migration of its web tier VM (**WEBMV**):

- A virtual network in which failed-over resources are located.
- A storage account to hold replicated data. 
- A Recovery Services vault in Azure.

Contoso sets up Site Recovery as follows:

1. Because the VM is a web front end to the SmartHotel app, Contoso fails over the VM to its existing production network (**VNET-PROD-EUS2**) and subnet (**PROD-FE-EUS2**). The network and subnet are located in the primary East US 2 region. Contoso set up the network when it [deployed the Azure infrastructure](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md).
2. Contoso creates a storage account (**contosovmsacc20180528**). Contoso uses a general-purpose account. Contoso selects standard storage and locally redundant storage replication.

    ![Site Recovery - Create storage account](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/asr-storage.png)

3. With the network and storage account in place, Contoso creates a vault (**ContosoMigrationVault**). Contoso places the vault in the **ContosoFailoverRG** resource group, in the primary East US 2 region.

    ![Recovery Services - Create vault](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/asr-vault.png)

*Need more help?*

Learn how to [set up Azure for Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure).


## Step 4: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery

To prepare VMware for Site Recovery, Contoso must complete these tasks:

- Prepare an account on the vCenter Server instance or vSphere ESXi host. The account automates VM discovery.
- Prepare an account that allows automatic installation of the Mobility Service on VMware VMs that Contoso wants to replicate.
- Prepare on-premises VMs to connect to Azure VMs when they're created after failover.


### Prepare an account for automatic discovery

Site Recovery needs access to VMware servers to:

- Automatically discover VMs. A minimum of a read-only account is required.
- Orchestrate replication, failover, and failback. Contoso needs an account that can run operations such as creating and removing disks and turning on VMs.

Contoso sets up the account by completing these tasks:

1. Creates a role at the vCenter level.
2. Assigns the required permissions to that role.

*Need more help?*

Learn how to [create and assign a role for automatic discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-automatic-discovery).

### Prepare an account for Mobility Service installation

The Mobility Service must be installed on the VM that Contoso wants to replicate. Contoso considers these factors about the Mobility Service:

- Site Recovery can do an automatic push installation of this component when Contoso enables replication for the VM.
- For automatic push installation, Contoso must prepare an account that Site Recovery uses to access the VM.
- Contoso specifies this account when it sets up replication in the Azure console.
- Contoso must have a domain or local account with permissions to install on the VM.

*Need more help*

Learn how to [create an account for push installation of the Mobility Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-mobility-service-installation).

### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover

After failover to Azure, Contoso wants to be able to connect to the replicated VMs in Azure. To connect to the replicated VMs in Azure, Contoso must complete a few tasks on the on-premises VM before the migration: 

1. For access over the internet, Contoso enables RDP on the on-premises VM before failover. Contoso ensures that TCP and UDP rules are added for the **Public** profile, and that RDP is allowed in **Windows Firewall** > **Allowed Apps** for all profiles.
2. For access over Contoso's site-to-site VPN, Contoso enables RDP on the on-premises machine. Contoso allows RDP in **Windows Firewall** > **Allowed apps and features** for **Domain and Private** networks.
3. Contoso sets the operating system's SAN policy on the on-premises VM to **OnlineAll**.

Contoso also needs to check these items when it runs a failover:

- There should be no Windows updates pending on the VM when a failover is triggered. If Windows updates are pending, Contoso can't sign in to the virtual machine until the update is finished.
- After failover, Contoso should check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM. If Contoso can't view the boot diagnostics, it should check that the VM is running, and then review [troubleshooting tips](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

## Step 5: Replicate the on-premises VMs to Azure by using Site Recovery

Before running a migration to Azure, Contoso needs to set up replication and enable replication for its on-premises VM.

### Set a replication goal

1. In the vault, under the vault name (**ContosoVMVault**), Contoso sets a replication goal (**Getting Started** > **Site Recovery** > **Prepare infrastructure**).
2. Contoso specifies that its machines are located on-premises, that they're VMware VMs, and that Contoso wants to replicate to Azure.

    ![Prepare infrastructure - Protection goal](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-goal.png)

### Confirm deployment planning

To continue, Contoso needs to confirm that it has completed deployment planning. To confirm, Contoso selects **Yes, I have done it**. In this deployment, Contoso is migrating only a single VM, so it doesn't need deployment planning.

### Set up the source environment

Now, Contoso needs to configure its source environment. To set up its source environment, Contoso downloads an OVF template. Contoso uses the template to deploy the configuration server and its associated components as a highly available, on-premises VMware VM. Components on the server include:

- The configuration server that coordinates communications between the on-premises infrastructure and Azure. The configuration server manages data replication.
- The process server that acts as a replication gateway. The process server:
    - Receives replication data.
    - Optimizes replication date by using caching, compression, and encryption.
    - Sends replication date to Azure Storage.
- The process server also installs the Mobility Service on the VMs that Contoso wants to replicate. The process server performs automatic discovery of on-premises VMware VMs.
- After the configuration server VM is created and started, Contoso registers the server in the vault.

To set up the source environment:

1. Contoso downloads the OVF template from the Azure portal (**Prepare Infrastructure** > **Source** > **Configuration Server**).
    
    ![Add a configuration server](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/add-cs.png)

2. Contoso imports the template into VMware to create and deploy the VM.

    ![Deploy OVF template](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/vcenter-wizard.png)

3.  When Contoso turns on the VM for the first time, the VM starts in a Windows Server 2016 installation experience. Contoso accepts the license agreement and enters an administrator password.
4. When the installation is finished, Contoso signs in to the VM as the administrator. The first time that Contoso signs in to the VM, the Azure Site Recovery Configuration Tool runs automatically.
5. In the Site Recovery Configuration Tool, Contoso enters a name to use to register the configuration server in the vault.
6. The tool checks the VM's connection to Azure. After the connection is established, Contoso selects **Sign in** to sign in to the Azure subscription. The credentials must have access to the vault in which the configuration server is registered. 

    ![Register the configuration server](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/config-server-register2.png)

7. The tool performs some configuration tasks, and then reboots. Contoso signs in to the machine again. The Configuration Server Management Wizard starts automatically.
8. In the wizard, Contoso selects the NIC to receive replication traffic. This setting can't be changed after it's configured.
9. Contoso selects the subscription, resource group, and Recovery Services vault in which to register the configuration server.

    ![Select Recovery Services vault](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/cswiz1.png)

10. Contoso downloads and installs MySQL Server and VMWare PowerCLI. Then, Contoso validates the server settings.
11. After validation, Contoso enters the FQDN or IP address of the vCenter Server instance or vSphere host. Contoso leaves the default port and enters a display name for the vCenter Server instance in Azure.
12. Contoso must specify the account that it created earlier so that Site Recovery can automatically discover VMware VMs that are available for replication. 
13. Contoso enters credentials, so the Mobility Service is automatically installed when replication is enabled. For Windows machines, the account needs local administrator permissions on the VMs. 

    ![Configure vCenter Server](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/cswiz2.png)

7. When registration is finished, in the Azure portal, Contoso verifies again that the configuration server and VMware server are listed on the **Source** page in the vault. Discovery can take 15 minutes or more. 
8. Site Recovery connects to VMware servers by using the specified settings. Site Recovery discovers VMs.

### Set up the target

Now, Contoso needs to configure the target replication environment:

1. In **Prepare infrastructure** > **Target**, Contoso selects the target settings.
2. Site Recovery checks that there's a storage account and network in the specified target.

### Create a replication policy

When the source and target are set up, Contoso creates a replication policy and associates the policy with the configuration server:

1. In  **Prepare infrastructure** > **Replication Settings** > **Replication Policy** >  **Create and Associate**, Contoso creates the **ContosoMigrationPolicy** policy.
2. Contoso uses the default settings:
    - **RPO threshold**: Default of 60 minutes. This value defines how often recovery points are created. An alert is generated if continuous replication exceeds this limit.
    - **Recovery point retention**: Default of 24 hours. This value specifies how long the retention window is for each recovery point. Replicated VMs can be recovered to any point in a window.
    - **App-consistent snapshot frequency**: Default of 1 hour. This value specifies the frequency at which application-consistent snapshots are created.
 
    ![Replication policy - Create](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-policy.png)

3. The policy is automatically associated with the configuration server. 

    ![Replication policy - Associate](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-policy2.png)

### Enable replication

Now, Contoso can start replicating WebVM.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **Replicate**, Contoso selects the source settings.
2. Contoso indicates that it wants to enable virtual machines, selects the vCenter Server instance, and sets the configuration server.

    ![Enable replication - Source](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication1.png)
 
3. Contoso specifies the target settings, including the resource group and network in which the Azure VM will be located after failover. Contoso specifies the storage account in which replicated data will be stored.

    ![Enable replication - Target](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication2.png)

4. Contoso selects **WebVM** for replication. Site Recovery installs the Mobility Service on each VM when replication is enabled. 

    ![Enable replication - Select the VM](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication3.png)

5. Contoso checks that the correct replication policy is selected. Then, it enables replication for **WEBVM**. Contoso tracks replication progress in **Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs, the machine is ready for failover.
6. In **Essentials** in the Azure portal, Contoso can see the structure for the VMs that are replicating to Azure:

    ![Infrastructure view](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/essentials.png)

## Step 6: Migrate the database by using the Database Migration Service

Contoso needs to create a Database Migration Service project, and then migrate the database.

### Create a Database Migration Service project

1. Contoso creates a Database Migration Service project. Contoso selects the **SQL Server** source server type. Contoso selects **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance** as the target.

     ![Database Migration Service - New migration project](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-project.png)

2. The Migration Wizard opens.

### Migrate the database 

1. In the Migration Wizard, Contoso specifies the source VM on which the on-premises database is located. Contoso enters the credentials to access the database.

    ![Database Migration Service - Source details](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-wizard-source.png)

2. Contoso selects the database to migrate (**SmartHotel.Registration**):

    ![Database Migration Service - Select source databases](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-wizard-sourcedb.png)

3. For the target, Contoso enters the name of the Managed Instance in Azure. Contoso enters access credentials for the Managed Instance.

    ![Database Migration Service - Target details](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-target-details.png)

4. In **New Activity** > **Run Migration**, Contoso specifies settings to run migration:
    - Source and target credentials.
    - The database to migrate.
    - The network share that Contoso created on the on-premises VM. The Database Migration Service takes source backups to this share. 
        - The service account that runs the source SQL Server instance must have write permissions on this share.
        - The FQDN path to the share must be used.
    - The SAS URI that provides the Database Migration Service with access to the storage account container to which the service uploads the backup files for migration.

        ![Database Migration Service - Configure migration settings](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-migration-settings.png)

5. Contoso saves the migration, and then runs it.
6. In **Overview**, Contoso monitors the migration status.

    ![Database Migration Service - Monitor](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-monitor1.png)

7. When migration is finished, Contoso verifies that the target databases exist on the Managed Instance.

    ![Database Migration Service - Verify the database migration](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-monitor2.png)

## Step 7: Migrate the VM by using Site Recovery

Contoso runs a quick test failover, and then migrates the VM.

### Run a test failover

Before migrating WEBVM, a test failover helps ensure that everything works as expected. Contoso completes the following steps:

1. Contoso runs a test failover to the latest available point in time (**Latest processed**).
2. Contoso selects **Shut down machine before beginning failover**. With this option selected, Site Recovery attempts to shut down the source VM before it triggers the failover. Failover continues, even if shutdown fails. 
3. Test failover runs: 
    1. A prerequisites check runs to make sure that all the conditions required for migration are in place.
    2. Failover processes the data so that an Azure VM can be created. If the latest recovery point is selected, a recovery point is created from the data.
    3.  Azure VM is created by using the data processed in the preceding step.
3. When the failover is finished, the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal. Contoso verifies that everything is working properly: the VM is the appropriate size, it's connected to the correct network, and it's running. 
4. After verifying the test failover, Contoso cleans up the failover. Then, it records and saves any observations. 

### Migrate the VM

1. After verifying that the test failover worked as expected, Contoso creates a recovery plan for migration. Contoso adds WEBVM to the plan:

     ![Create recovery plan - Select items](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/recovery-plan.png)

2. Contoso runs a failover on the plan. Contoso selects the latest recovery point. Contoso specifies that Site Recovery should try to shut down the on-premises VM before it triggers the failover.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover1.png)

3. After the failover, Contoso verifies that the Azure VM appears as expected in the Azure portal.

   ![Recovery plan details](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover2.png)

4. After verifying the VM in Azure, Contoso completes the migration to finish the migration process, stop replication for the VM, and stop Site Recovery billing for the VM.

    ![Failover - Complete migration](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover3.png)

### Update the connection string

As the final step in the migration process, Contoso updates the connection string of the application to point to the migrated database that's running on Contoso's Managed Instance.

1. In the Azure portal, Contoso finds the connection string by selecting **Settings** > **Connection Strings**.

    ![Connection strings](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover4.png)  

2. Contoso updates the string with the user name and password of the SQL Database Managed Instance.
3. After the string is configured, Contoso replaces the current connection string in the web.config file of its application.
4. After updating the file and saving it, Contoso restarts IIS on WEBVM. To restart IIS, Contoso runs `IISRESET /RESTART` in a Command Prompt window.
5. After IIS is restarted, the app uses the database that's running on the SQL Database Managed Instance.
6. At this point, Contoso can shut down on-premises the SQLVM machine. The migration has been completed.

## Clean up after migration

With the migration complete, the SmartHotel app is running on an Azure VM and the SmartHotel database is available in the Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.  

Now, Contoso needs to do the following cleanup tasks:  

- Remove the WEBVM machine from the vCenter Server inventory.
- Remove the SQLVM machine from the vCenter Server inventory.
- Remove WEBVM and SQLVM from local backup jobs.
- Update internal documentation to show the new location and IP address for WEBVM.
- Remove SQLVM from internal documentation. Alternatively, Contoso can revise the documentation to show SQLVM as deleted and no longer in the VM inventory.
- Review any resources that interact with the decommissioned VMs. Update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.

## Review the deployment

With the migrated resources in Azure, Contoso needs to fully operationalize and secure its new infrastructure.

### Security

The Contoso security team reviews the Azure VMs and SQL Database Managed Instance to check for any security issues with its implementation:

- The security team reviews the network security groups that are used to control access for the VM. Network security groups help ensure that only traffic that is allowed to the app can pass.
- Contoso's security team also is considering securing the data on the disk by using Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Key Vault.
- The security team enables threat detection on the Managed Instance. Threat detection sends an alert to Contoso's security team/service desk system to open a ticket if a threat is detected. Learn more about [threat detection for Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-threat-detection).

     ![Managed Instance security - Threat detection](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-security.png)  

To learn more about security practices for VMs, see [Security best practices for IaaS workloads in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#vm-authentication-and-access-control).

### Backups

Contoso backs up the data on WEBVM by using the Azure Backup service. Learn more about [Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

### Licensing and cost optimization

- Contoso has an existing licensing for WEBVM. To take advantage of pricing with Azure Hybrid Benefit, Contoso converts the existing Azure VM.
- Contoso enables Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary. Cost Management is a multi-cloud cost management solution that helps Contoso use and manage Azure and other cloud resources. Learn more about [Azure Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/overview).
