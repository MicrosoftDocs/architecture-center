# Contoso - Deploy a migration infrastructure

This article examines how Contoso sets up an on-premises and Azure infrastructure, in preparation for migration to Azure, and for running the business in a hybrid environment.

- It's a sample architecture that's specific to Contoso.
- Whether you need all the elements described in the article depends upon your migration strategy. For example, if you're building only cloud-native apps in Azure, you might need a less complex networking structure.

This document is the second in series of articles that document how the fictitious company Contoso migrates on-premises resources to the Microsoft Azure cloud. The series includes information and deployment scenarios that illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure, assess the suitability of on-premises resources for migration, and run different types of migrations. Scenarios grow in complexity, and we'll be adding additional articles over time.

## Overview

Before they can migrate to Azure, it's critical that Contoso prepares an Azure infrastructure.  Generally, there are five broad areas they need to think about:

**Step 1: Azure subscriptions**: How will they purchase Azure, and interact with the Azure platform and services?  
**Step 2: Hybrid identity**: How will they manage and control access to on-premises and Azure resources after migration? How do they extend or move identity management to the cloud?  
**Step 3: Disaster recovery and resilience**: How will they ensure that their apps and infrastructure are resilient if outages and disasters occur?  
**Step 4: Networking**: How should they design your networking infrastructure, and establish connectivity between their on-premises datacenter and Azure?  
**Step 5: Security**: How will they secure their hybrid/Azure deployment?  
**Step 6: Governance**: How will they keep their deployment aligned with security and governance requirements?

## Before you start

Before we start looking at the infrastructure, you might want to read some background information about the Azure capabilities we discuss in this article:

- There are a number of options available for purchasing Azure access, including Pay-As-You-Go, Enterprise Agreements (EA), or Open Licensing from Microsoft resellers, or from Microsoft Partners know as Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs). Learn about [purchase options](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/), and read about how [Azure subscriptions are organized](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/organizing-subscriptions-and-resource-groups-within-the-enterprise/).
- Get an overview of Azure [identity and access management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/security/identity). In particular, learn about [Azure AD and extending on-premises AD to the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-fundamentals). There's a useful downloadable e-book about [identity and access management (IAM) in a hybrid environment](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/hybrid-cloud-identity/).
- Azure provides a robust networking infrastructure with options for hybrid connectivity. Get an overview of [networking and network access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/security-network-overview).
- Get an introduction to [Azure Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security), and read about creating a plan for [governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/governance-in-azure).


## On-premises architecture

Here's a diagram showing the current Contoso on-premises infrastructure.

 ![Contoso architecture](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/contoso-architecture.png)  

- Contoso has one main datacenter located in the city of New York in the Eastern United States.
- They have three additional local branches across the United States.
- The main datacenter is connected to the internet with a fiber metro ethernet connection (500 mbps).
- Each branch is connected locally to the internet using business class connections, with IPSec VPN tunnels back to the main datacenter. This allows their entire network to be permanently connected, and optimizes internet connectivity.
- The main datacenter is fully virtualized with VMware. They have two ESXi 6.5 virtualization hosts, managed by vCenter Server 6.5.
- Contoso uses Active Directory for identity management, and DNS servers on the internal network.
- The domain controllers in the datacenter run on VMware VMs. The domain controllers at local branches run on physical servers.


## Step 1: Buy and subscribe to Azure

Contoso needs to figure out how to buy Azure, how to architect subscriptions, and how to license services and resources.

### Buy Azure

Contoso is going with an [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/). This entails an upfront monetary commitment to Azure, entitling them to earn great benefits, including flexible billing options and optimized pricing.

- Contoso estimated what their yearly Azure spend will be. When they signed the agreement, they paid for the first year in full.
- Contoso needs to use all commitments before the year is over, or they'll lose the value for those dollars.
- If for some reason they exceed their commitment and spend more, Microsoft will invoice them for the difference.
- Any cost incurred above the commitment will be at the same rates and those in their contract. There are no penalties for going over.

### Manage subscriptions

After paying for Azure, Contoso needs to figure out how to manage Azure subscriptions. They have an EA, and thus no limit on the number of Azure subscriptions they can set up.

- An Azure Enterprise Enrollment defines how a company shape and uses Azure services, and defines a core governance structure.
- As a first step, Contoso has determined a structure (known as an enterprise scaffold for their  Enterprise Enrollment. They used [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-subscription-governance) to help them understand and design a scaffold.
- For now, Contoso has decided to use a functional approach to manage their subscriptions.
    - Inside their enterprise they'll have a single IT department that controls the Azure budget. This will be the only group with subscriptions.
    - They'll extend this model in the future, so that other corporate groups can join as departments in the Enterprise Enrollment.
    - Inside the IT department Contoso has structured two subscriptions, Production and Development.
    - If Contoso requires additional subscriptions in the future, they'll need to manage access, policies and compliance for those subscriptions. They'll be able to do that by introducing [Azure management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-overview), as an additional layer above subscriptions.

    ![Enterprise structure](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/enterprise-structure.png) 

### Examine licensing

With subscriptions configured, Contoso can look at their Microsoft licensing. Their licensing strategy will depend on the resources that they want to migrate into Azure, and how Azure VMs and services are selected and deployed. 

#### Azure Hybrid Benefit

When deploying VMs in Azure, standard images include a license that will charge Contoso by the minute for the software being used. However, Contoso has been a long-term Microsoft customer, and has maintained EAs and open licenses with software assurance (SA). 

Azure Hybrid Benefit provides a cost-effective method for Contoso migration, by allowing them to save on Azure VMs and SQL Server workloads by converting or reusing Windows Server Datacenter and Standard edition licenses covered with Software Assurance. This will enable Contoso to pay a lower based compute rate for VMs and SQL Server. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/).


#### License Mobility

License Mobility through SA gives Microsoft Volume Licensing customers like Contoso the flexibility to deploy eligible server apps with active SA on Azure. This eliminates the need to purchase new licenses. With no associated mobility fees, existing licenses can easily be deployed in Azure. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/license-mobility/).

#### Reserve instances for predictable workloads

Predictable workloads are those that always need to be available with VMs running. For example, line-of-business apps such as a SAP ERP system.  On the other hand, unpredictable workloads are those that are variable. For example VMs that are on during high demand and off at non-peak times.

![Reserved instance](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/reserved-instance.png) 

In exchange for using reserved instances for specific VM instances that they know need to be maintained for large durations of time, Console can get both a discount, and prioritized capacity. Using [Azure Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/), together with Azure Hybrid Benefit, Contoso can save up to 82% off regular pay-as-you-go pricing (April 2018).


## Step 2: Manage hybrid identity

Giving and controlling user access to Azure resources with identity and access management (IAM) is an important step in pulling together your Azure infrastructure.  

- Contoso decides to extend their on-premises Active Directory into the cloud, rather than build a new separate system in Azure.
- They create an Azure-based Active Directory to do this.
- Contoso doesn't have Office 365 in place, so they need to provision a new Azure AD.
- Office 365 uses Azure AD for user management. If Contoso was using Office 365, they would already have an Azure AD tenet, and use that as their primary AD.
- [Learn more](https://support.office.com/article/understanding-office-365-identity-and-azure-active-directory-06a189e7-5ec6-4af2-94bf-a22ea225a7a9) about Azure AD for Office 365, and learn [how to add a subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory) to an existing Azure AD.

### Create an Azure AD

Contoso is using the Azure AD Free edition that's included with an Azure subscription. Add a new AD directory as follows:

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), Contoso goes to **Create a resource** > **Identity** > **Azure Active Directory**.
2. In **Create Directory**, they specify a name for the directory, an initial domain name, and region in which the Azure AD directory should be created.

    ![Create Azure AD](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/azure-ad-create.png) 

    > [!NOTE]
    > When they create the directory it has an initial domain name in the form domainname.onmicrosoft.com. The name can't be changed or deleted. Instead, they need to add their registered domain name to Azure AD.

### Add the domain name

To use their standard domain name, Contoso needs to add it as a custom name to Azure AD. This option allows admins to assign familiar user names. For example, a user can log in with email address billg@contoso.com, rather than needing billg@contosomigration.onmicrosoft.com. 

To set up custom name they add it to the directory, add a DNS entry, and then verify the name in Azure AD.

1. In **Custom domain names** > **Add custom domain**, they add the domain.
2. To use a DNS entry in Azure they need to register it with their domain registrar. 

    - In the **Custom domain names** list, they note the DNS information for the name. Contoso is using an MX entry.
    - They need access to the name server to do this. In the case of Contoso, they logged into the Contoso.com domain, and created a new MX record for the DNS entry provided by Azure AD, using the details noted.  
1. After the DNS records propagate, in the details name for the domain, they click **Verify** to check the custom name.

     ![Azure AD DNS](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/azure-ad-dns.png) 

### Set up on-premises and Azure groups and users

Now that their Azure AD is up and running, Contoso needs to add employees to on-premises AD groups that will synchronize to Azure AD. We recommend that they use on-premises group names that match the names of resource groups in Azure. This makes it easier to identify matches for synchronization purposes.

#### Create resource groups in Azure

Azure resource groups gather Azure resources together. Using a resource group ID allows Azure to perform operations on the resources within the group.

- An Azure subscription can have multiple resource groups, but a resource group can only exist within a single subscription.
- In addition, a single resource group can have multiple resources, but a resource can only belong to a single group.

Contoso sets up Azure resource groups as summarized in the following table.

**Resource group** | **Details**
--- | ---
**ContosoCobRG** | This group contains all resources related to continuity of business (COB).  It includes vaults that Contoso will create when using the Azure Site Recovery service, and the Azure Backup service.<br/><br/> It will also include resources used for migration, including the Azure Migrate and Database Migration Services.
**ContosoDevRG** | This group contains development and test resources.
**ContosoFailoverRG** | This group serves as a landing zone for failed over resources.
**ContosoNetworkingRG** | This group contains all networking resources.
**ContosoRG** | This group contains resources related to production apps and databases.

They create resource groups as follows:

1. In the Azure portal > **Resource groups**, they add a group.
2. For each group they specify a name, the subscription to which the group belongs, and the region.
3. Resource groups appear in the **Resource groups** list.

    ![Resource groups](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/resource-groups.png) 


#### Create matching security groups on-premises

1. In their on-premises Active Directory, Contoso sets up security groups with names that match the names of the Azure resource groups.
 
    ![On-premises AD security groups](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/on-prem-ad.png) 

2. For management purposes, they create an additional group that will be added to all of the other groups. This group will have rights to all resource groups in Azure. A limited number of Global Admins will be added to this group.

### Synchronize AD

Contoso wants to provide a common identity for accessing resources on-premises and in the cloud. To do this, they integrate their on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD. With this model:

- Users and organizations can take advantage of a single identity to access on-premises applications and cloud services such as Office 365, or thousands of other sites on the internet.
- Admins can leverage the groups in AD to implement [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) in Azure.

To facilitate integration, Contoso uses the [Azure AD Connect tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect). When you install and configure the tool on a domain controller, it synchronizes the local on-premises AD identities to the Azure AD. 

### Download the tool

1. In the Azure portal, Azure goes to **Azure Active Directory** > **Azure AD Connect**, and downloads the latest version of the tool to the server they're using for synchronization.

    ![Download AD Connect](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/download-ad-connect.png) 

2. They start the **AzureADConnect.msi** installation, using **Use express settings**. This is the most common installation, and can be used for a single-forest topology, with password hash synchronization for authentication.

    ![AD Connect Wizard](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-connect-wiz1.png) 

3. In **Connect to Azure AD**, they specify the credentials for connecting to the Azure AD (in the form CONTOSO\admin or contoso.com\admin).

    ![AD Connect Wizard](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-connect-wiz2.png) 

4. In **Connect to AD DS**, they specify credentials for their on-premises AD.

     ![AD Connect Wizard](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-connect-wiz3.png) 

5. In **Ready to configure**, they click **Start the synchronization process when configuration completes** to start the sync immediately. Then they install.

Note that:
- Contoso has a direct connection to Azure. If your on-premises AD is behind a proxy, read this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-troubleshoot-connectivity).
- After the first synchronization, on-premises AD objects can be seen in the Azure AD.

    ![On-premises AD in Azure](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/on-prem-ad-groups.png) 

- Contoso IT team is represented in each group, based on its role.

    ![On-premises AD members in Azure](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/on-prem-ad-group-members.png) 

### Set up RBAC

Azure [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can grant only the amount of access that users need to perform their jobs. You assign the appropriate RBAC role to users, groups, and applications at a scope level. The scope of a role assignment can be a subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. 

Contoso now assigns roles to the AD groups that they synchronized from on-premises.

1. In the **ControlCobRG** resource group, they click **Access control (IAM)** > **Add**.
2. In **Add Permissions** > **Role**, they select **Contributor**, and select the **ContosoCobRG** AD group from the list. The group then appears in  **Selected members** list. 
3. They repeat this with the same permissions for the other resource groups (except for **ContosoAzureAdmins**), by adding the Contributor permissions to the AD account that matches the resource group.
4. For the **ContosoAzureAdmins** AD group, they assign the **Owner** role.

    ![On-premises AD members in Azure](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/on-prem-ad-groups.png) 


## Step 3: Design for resilience and disaster

Azure resources are deployed within regions.
- Regions are organized into geographies, and data residency, sovereignty, compliance and resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.
- A region is composed of a set of datacenters. These datacenters are deployed within a latency-defined perimeter, and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.
- Each Azure region is paired with a different region for resiliency.
- Read about [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/), and understand [how regions are paired](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions).


Contoso has decided to go with the East US 2 (located in Virginia) as their primary region, and Central US as their secondary region. There are a couple of reasons for this:

- The Contoso datacenter is located in New York, and they considered latency to the closest datacenter.
- The East US 2 region has all the service and products they need to use. Not all Azure regions are the same in terms of the products and services available. You can review [Azure products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).
- Central US is the Azure paired region for East US 2.

As they think about their hybrid environment, Contoso needs to consider how to build resilience and a disaster recovery strategy into their region design. Broadly, strategies range from a single-region deployment, which relies on Azure platform features such as fault domains and regional pairing for resilience, through to a full Active-Active model in which cloud services and database are deployed and servicing users from two regions.

Contoso has decided to take a middle road. They'll deploy their apps and resources in a primary region, and keep a full infrastructure in the secondary region, so that it's ready to act as a full backup in case of complete app disaster, or region failure.


## Step 4: Design a network infrastructure

With their region design in place, Contoso is ready to consider a networking strategy. They need to think about how their on-premises datacenter and Azure connect and communicate with each other, and how to design your network infrastructure in Azure. Specifically they need to:

**Plan hybrid network connectivity**: Figure out how they're going to connect networks across on-premises and Azure.
**Design an Azure network infrastructure**: Decide how they'll deploy networks over their regions. How will networks communicate within the same region, and across regions.
**Design and set up Azure networks**: Set up Azure networks and subnets, and decide what will reside in them.

### Plan hybrid network connectivity

Contoso considered a [number of architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/) for hybrid networking between Azure and their on-premises datacenter. [Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/considerations) about comparing options.

As a reminder, the Contoso on-premises network infrastructure currently consists of their datacenter in New York, and local branches in the eastern portion of the US.  All locations have a business class connection to the internet.  Each of the branches is then connected to the datacenter via a IPSec VPN tunnel over the internet.

![Contoso network](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/contoso-networking.png) 

Here's how Contoso decided to implement hybrid connectivity:

1. Set up a new site-to-site VPN connection between the Contoso datacenter in New York and the two Azure regions in East US 2 and Central US.
2. Branch office traffic bound for Azure virtual networks will route through the main Contoso datacenter. 
3. As they scale up their Azure deployment, they'll establish an ExpressRoute connection between their datacenter and the Azure regions. When this happens, they'll retain the VPN site-to-site connection for failover purposes only.
    - [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/considerations) about choosing between a VPN and ExpressRoute hybrid solution.
    - Verify [ExpressRoute locations and support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations-providers).


**VPN only**

![Contoso VPN](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/hybrid-vpn.png) 


**VPN and ExpressRoute**

![Contoso VPN/ExpressRoute](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/hybrid-vpn-expressroute.png) 


### Design the Azure network infrastructure

It's critical that Contoso puts networks in place in a way that makes their hybrid deployment secure and scalable. To do this, Contoso are taking a long-term approach, and are designing virtual networks (VNets) to be resilience and enterprise ready. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm) about planning VNets.

To connect their two regions, Contoso has decided to implement a hub-to-hub network model:

- Within each region, Contoso will use a hub-and-spoke model.
- To connect networks and  hubs, Contoso will use Azure network peering.

#### Network peering

Azure provides network peering to connect VNets and hubs. Global peering allows connections between VNets/hubs in different regions. Local peering connects VNets in the same region. VNet peering provide a number of advantages:

- Network traffic between peered VNets is private.
- Traffic between the VNets is kept on the Microsoft backbone network. No public internet, gateways, or encryption is required in the communication between the VNets.
- Peering provides a default, low-latency, high-bandwidth connection between resources in different VNets.

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) about network peering.

#### Hub-to-hub across regions

Contoso will deploy a hub in each region. A hub is a virtual network (VNet) in Azure that acts as a central point of connectivity to your on-premises network. The hub VNets will connect to each other using global VNet peering. Global VNet peering connects VNets across Azure regions.

- The hub in each region is peered to its partner hub in the other region.
- The hub is peered to every network in its region, and can connect to all network resources.

    ![Global peering](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/global-peering.png) 

#### Hub-and-spoke within a region

Within each region, Contoso will deploy VNets for different purposes, as spoke networks from the region hub. VNets within a region use peering to connect to their hub, and to each other.

#### Design the hub network

Within the hub and spoke model that Contoso has chosen, they need to think about how traffic from their on-premises datacenter, and from the internet, will be routed. Here's how Contoso has decided to handle routing for both the East US 2 and Central US hubs:

- They're designing a network known as "reverse c", as this is the path that the packets follow from the inbound to outbound network.
- Their network architecture has two boundaries, an untrusted front-end perimeter zone and a back-end trusted zone.
- A firewall will have a network adapter in each zone, controlling access to trusted zones.
- From the internet:
    - Internet traffic will hit a load-balanced public IP address on the perimeter network.
    - This traffic is routed through the firewall, and subject to firewall rules.
    - After network access controls are implemented, traffic will be forwarded to the appropriate location in the trusted zone.
    - Outbound traffic from the VNet will be routed to the internet using user-defined routes (UDRs). The traffic is forced through the firewall, and inspected in line with Contoso policies.
- From the Contoso datacenter:
    - Incoming traffic over VPN site-to-site (or ExpressRoute) hits the public IP address of the Azure VPN gateway.
    - Traffic is routed through the firewall and subject to firewall rules.
    - After applying rules traffic is forwarded to an internal load balancer (Standard SKU) on the trusted internal zone subnet.
    - Outbound traffic from the trusted subnet to the on-premises datacenter over VPN is routed through the firewall, and rules applied, before going over the VPN site-to-site connection.



### Design and set up Azure networks

With a network and routing topology in place, Contoso is ready to set up their Azure networks and subnets.

- Contoso will implement a Class A private network in Azure (0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255). This works, since on-premises they current have a Class B private address space 172.160.0/16 so they can be sure there won't be any overlap between address ranges.
- They're going to deploy VNets in their primary and secondary regions.
- They'll use a naming convention that includes the prefix **VNET** and the region abbreviation **EUS2** or **CUS**. Using this standard, the hub networks will be named **VNET-HUB-EUS2** (East US 2), and **VNET-HUB-CUS** (Central US).
- Contoso doesn't have an [IPAM solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/technologies/ipam/ipam-top), so they need to plan for network routing without NAT.


#### Virtual networks in East US 2

East US 2 is the primary region that Contoso will use to deploy resources and services. Here's how they're going to architect networks within it:

- **Hub**: The hub VNet in East US 2 is the central point of primary connectivity to their on-premises datacenter.
- **VNets**: Spoke VNets in East US 2 can be used to isolate workloads if required. In addition to the Hub VNet, Contoso will have two spoke VNets in East US 2:
    - **VNET-DEV-EUS2**. This VNet will provide the development and test team will a fully functional network for dev projects. It will act as a production pilot area, and will rely on the production infrastructure to function.
    - **VNET-PROD-EUS2**: Azure IaaS production components will be located in this network. 
    -  Each VNet will have its own unique address space, with no overlap. They intend to configure routing without requiring NAT.
- **Subnets**:
    - There will be a subnet in each network for each app tier
    - Each subnet in the Production network will have a matching subnet in the Dev VNet.
    - In addition, the Production network has a subnet for domain controllers.

VNets in East  US 2 are summarized in the following table.

**VNet** | **Range** | **Peer**
--- | --- | ---
**VNET-HUB-EUS2** | 10.240.0.0/20 | VNET-HUB-CUS2, VNET-DEV-EUS2, VNET-PROD-EUS2
**VNET-DEV-EUS2** | 10.245.16.0/20 | VNET-HUB-EUS2
**VNET-PROD-EUS2** | 10.245.32.0/20 | VNET-HUB-EUS2, VNET-PROD-CUS

--- | --- | ---
**IB-UntrustZone** | 10.240.0.0/24 | 251
**IB-TrustZone** | 10.240.1.0/24 | 251
**OB-UntrustZone** | 10.240.2.0/24 | 251
**OB-TrustZone** | 10.240.3.0/24 | 251
**GatewaySubnets** | 10.240.10.0/24 | 251


#### Subnets in the East US 2 Dev network (VNET-DEV-EUS2)

The Dev VNet is used by the development team as a production pilot area. It has three subnets.

**Subnet** | **CIDR** | **Addresses** | **In subnet**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**DEV-FE-EUS2** | 10.245.16.0/22 | 1019 | Frontends/web tier VMs
**DEV-APP-EUS2** | 10.245.20.0/22 | 1019 | App-tier VMs
**DEV-DB-EUS2** | 10.245.24.0/23 | 507 | Database VMs


#### Subnets in the East US 2 Production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2)

Azure IaaS components are located in the Production network. Each app tier has its own subnet. Subnets match those in the Dev network, with the addition of a subnet for domain controllers.

**Subnet** | **CIDR** | **Addresses** | **In subnet**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**PROD-FE-EUS2** | 10.245.32.0/22 | 1019 | Frontends/web tier VMs
**PROD-APP-EUS2** | 10.245.36.0/22 | 1019 | App-tier VMs
**PROD-DB-EUS2** | 10.245.40.0/23 | 507 | Database VMs
**PROD-DC-EUS2** | 10.245.42.0/23 | 251 | Domain controller VMs

#### Virtual networks in Central US (secondary region)

Central US is Contoso's secondary region. Here's how they're going to architect networks within it:

- **Hub**: The hub Vnet in East US 2 is the central point of connectivity to their on-premises datacenter, and the spoke VNets in East US 2 can be used to isolate workloads if required, managed separately from other spokes.
- **VNets**: They will have two VNets in Central US:
    - VNET-PROD-CUS. This VNet is a production network, similar to VNET-PROD_EUS2. 
    - VNET-ASR-CUS. This VNet will act as a location in which VMs are created after failover from on-premises, or as a location for Azure VMs that are failed over from the primary to the secondary region. This network is similar to the production networks, but without any domain controllers on it.
    -  Each VNet in the region will have its own address space, with no overlap. They intend to configure routing without requiring NAT.
- **Subnets**: The subnets will be architected in a similar way to those in East US 2. The exception is that they don't need a subnet for domain controllers.

The VNets in Central US are summarized in the following table.

**VNet** | **Range** | **Peer**
--- | --- | ---
**VNET-HUB-CUS** | 10.250.0.0/20 | VNET-HUB-EUS2, VNET-ASR-CUS, VNET-PROD-CUS
**VNET-ASR-CUS** | 10.255.16.0/20 | VNET-HUB-CUS, VNET-PROD-CUS
**VNET-PROD-CUS** | 10.255.32.0/20 | VNET-HUB-CUS, VNET-ASR-CUS, VNET-PROD-EUS2  


![Hub/spoke in paired region](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/paired-hub-peer.png)


#### Subnets in the  Central US Hub network (VNET-HUB-CUS)

**Subnet** | **CIDR** | **Usable IP addresses**
--- | --- | ---
**IB-UntrustZone** | 10.250.0.0/24 | 251
**IB-TrustZone** | 10.250.1.0/24 | 251
**OB-UntrustZone** | 10.250.2.0/24 | 251
**OB-TrustZone** | 10.250.3.0/24 | 251
**GatewaySubnet** | 10.250.2.0/24 | 251


#### Subnets in the Central US Production network (VNET-PROD-CUS)

In parallel to the production network in the primary East US 2 region, there's a production network in the secondary Central US region. 

**Subnet** | **CIDR** | **Addresses** | **In subnet**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**PROD-FE-CUS** | 10.255.32.0/22 | 1019 | Frontends/web tier VMs
**PROD-APP-CUS** | 10.255.36.0/22 | 1019 | App-tier VMs
**PROD-DB-CUS** | 10.255.40.0/23 | 507 | Database VMs
**PROD-DC-CUS** | 10.255.42.0/24 | 251 | Domain controller VMs

#### Subnets in the Central US failover/recovery network in Central US (VNET-ASR-CUS)

The VNET-ASR-CUS network is used for purposes of failover between regions. Site Recovery will be used to replicate and fail over Azure VMs between the regions. It also functions as a Contoso datacenter to Azure network for protected workloads that remain on-premises, but fail over to Azure for disaster recovery.

VNET-ASR-CUS is the same basic subnet as the production VNET in East US 2, but without the need for a domain controller subnet.

**Subnet** | **CIDR** | **Addresses** | **In subnet**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**ASR-FE-CUS** | 10.255.16.0/22 | 1019 | Frontends/web tier VMs
**ASR-APP-CUS** | 10.255.20.0/22 | 1019 | App-tier VMs
**ASR-DB-CUS** | 10.255.24.0/23 | 507 | Database VMs

![Hub network architecture](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/azure-networks-cus.png)

#### Configure peered connections

The hub in each region will be peered to the hub in the other region, and to all VNets within the hub region. This allows for hubs to communicate, and to view all VNets within a region. Note that:

- Peering creates a two-sided connection. One from the initiating peer on the first VNet, and another one on the second VNet.
- In a hybrid deployment, traffic that passes between peers needs to be seen from the VPN connection between the on-premises datacenter and Azure. To enable this, there are some specific settings that must be set on peered connections.

For any connections from spoke VNets through the hub to the on-premises datacenter, Contoso needs to allow traffic to be forwarded, and transverse the VPN gateways.

##### Domain controller

For the domain controllers in the VNET-PROD-EUS2 network, Contoso wants traffic to flow both between the EUS2 hub/production network, and over the VPN connection to on-premises. To do this they need to allow the following:

1. **Allow forwarded traffic** and **Allow gateway transit configurations** on the peered connection. In our example this would be the VNET-HUB-EUS2 to VNET-PROD-EUS2 connection.

    ![Peering](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/peering1.png)

2. **Allow forwarded traffic** and **Use remote gateways** on the other side of the peering, on the VNET-PROD-EUS2 to VNET-HUB-EUS2 connection.

    ![Peering](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/peering2.png)

3. On-premises they will set up a static route that directs the local traffic to route across the VPN tunnel to the VNet. The configuration would be completed on the gateway that provides the VPN tunnel from Contoso to Azure. Contoso uses Windows Routing and Remote Access for this.

    ![Peering](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/peering3.png)

##### Production networks 

A spoked peer network can't see a spoked peer network in another region via a hub.

For Contoso's production networks in both regions to see each other, they need to create a direct peered connection for VNET-PROD-EUS2 and VENT-PROD-CUS. 

![Peering](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/peering4.png)

### Set up DNS

When you deploy resources in virtual networks, you have a couple of choices for domain name resolution. You can use name resolution provided by Azure, or provide DNS servers for resolution. The type of name resolution you use depends on how your resources need to communicate with each other. Get [more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances#azure-provided-name-resolution) about the Azure DNS service.

Contoso have decided that the Azure DNS service isn't a good choice in their hybrid environment. Instead, they're going to leverage their on-premises DNS servers.

- Since this is a hybrid network all the VMs on-premises and in Azure need to be able to resolve names to function properly. This means that custom DNS settings must be applied to all the VNets.
- Contoso currently has DCs deployed in the Contoso datacenter and at the branch offices. Their primary DNS servers are CONTOSODC1(172.16.0.10) and CONTOSODC2(172.16.0.1)
- When the VNets are deployed, the on-premises domain controllers will be set to be used as DNS server in the networks. 
- To configure this, when using custom DNS on the VNet, Azure's recursive resolvers IP address (such as 168.63.129.16) must be added to the DNS list.  To do this, Contoso configures DNS server settings on each VNet. For example, the custom DNS settings for the VNET-HUB-EUS2 network would be as follows:
    
    ![Custom DNS](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/custom-dns.png)

In addition to their on-premises domain controllers, Contoso are going to implement four more to support their Azure networks, two for each region. Here's what they'll deploy in Azure.

**Region** | **DC** | **VNet** | **Subnet** | **IP address**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
EUS2 | CONTOSODC3 | VNET-PROD-EUS2 | PROD-DC-EUS2 | 10.245.42.4
EUS2 | CONTOSODC4 | VNET-PROD-EUS2 | PROD-DC-EUS2 | 10.245.42.5
CUS | CONTOSODC5 | VNET-PROD-CUS | PROD-DC-CUS | 10.255.42.4
CUS | CONTOSODC6 | VNET-PROD-CUS | PROD-DC-CUS | 10.255.42.4

After deploying the on-premises domain controllers, Contoso needs to update the DNS settings on networks on either region to include the new domain controllers in their DNS server list.



#### Set up domain controllers in Azure

After updating network settings, Contoso is ready to build out their domain controllers in Azure.

1. In the Azure portal, they deploy a new Windows Server VM to the appropriate VNet.
2. They create availability sets in each location for the VM. Availability sets do the following:
    - Ensure that the Azure fabric separates the VMs into different infrastructures in the Azure Region. 
    -  Allows Contoso to be eligible for the 99.95% SLA for VMs in Azure.  [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets).

    ![Availability group](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/availability-group.png) 
3. After the VM is deployed, they pen the network interface for the VM. Here, they set the private IP address to static, and specify a valid address.

    ![VM NIC](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/vm-nic.png)

4. Now, they attach a new data disk to the VM. This disk contains the Active Directory database, and the sysvol share. 
    - The size of the disk will determine the number of IOPS that it supports.
    - Over time the disk size might need to increase as the environment grows.
    - The drive shouldn't be set to Read/Write for host caching. Active Directory databases don't support this.

     ![Active Directory disk](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-disk.png)

5. After the disk is added, they connect to the VM over Remote Desktop, and open Server Manager.
6. Then in **File and Storage Services**, they run the New Volume Wizard, ensuring that the drive is given the letter F: or above on the local VM.

     ![New Volume Wizard](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/volume-wizard.png)

7. In Server Manager, they add the **Active Directory Domain Services** role. Then, they configure the VM as a domain controller.

      ![Server role](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/server-role.png)  

9. After the VM is configured as a DC and rebooted, they open DNS Manager and configure the Azure DNS resolver as a forwarder.  This allows the DC to forward DNS queries it can't resolve in the Azure DNS.

    ![DNS forwarder](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/dns-forwarder.png)

10. Now, then update the custom DNS settings for each VNet with the appropriate domain controller for the VNet region. They include on-premises DCs in the list.

### Set up Active Directory

AD is a critical service in networking, and must be configured correctly. Contoso will build AD sites for the Contoso datacenter, and for the EUS2 and CUS regions.  

1. They create two new sites (AZURE-EUS2, and AZURE-CUS) along with the datacenter site (ContosoDatacenter).
2. After creating the sites, they create subnets in the sites, to match the VNets and datacenter.

    ![DC subnets](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/dc-subnets.png)

3. Then, they create two site links to connect everything. The domain controllers should then be moved to their location.

    ![DC links](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/dc-links.png)

4. After everything is configured, the Active Directory replication topology is in place.
    
    ![DC replication](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-resolution.png)

5. With everything complete, a list of the domain controllers and sites are shown in the on-premises Active Directory Administrative Center.

    ![AD admin center](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/ad-center.png)

## Step 5: Plan for governance

Azure provides a range of governance controls across services and the Azure platform. [Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/governance-in-azure) for a basic understanding of options.

As they configure identity and access control, Contoso has already begun to put some aspects of governance and security in place. Broadly, there are three areas they need to consider:

- **Policy**: Policy in Azure applies and enforces rules and effects over your resources, so that resources stay compliant with corporate requirements and SLAs.
- **Locks**: Azure allows you to lock subscriptions, resources groups, and other resources, so that they can only be modified by those with authority to do so.
- **Tags**: Resources can be controlled, audited, and managed with tags. Tags attach metadata to resources, providing information about resources or owners.

### Set up policies

The Azure Policy service evaluates your resources, scanning for those not compliant with the policy definitions you have in place. For example, might have a policy that only allows certain type of VMs, or requires resources to have a specific tag. 

Azure policies specify a policy definition, and policy assignment specify the scope in which a policy should be applied. The scope can range from a management group to a resource group. [Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-policy/create-manage-policy) about creating and managing policies.

Contoso want to get started with a couple of policies:

- They want a policy to ensure that resources can only be deployed in the EUS2 and CUS regions.
- They want to limit VM SKUs to approved SKUs only. The intention is to ensure that expensive VM SKUs aren't used.

#### Limit resources to regions

Contoso uses the built-in policy definition **Allowed locations** to limit resource regions.

1. In the Azure portal, click **All Services**, and search for **Policy**.
2. Select **Assignments** > **Assign Policy**.
3. In the policy list, select **Allowed locations**.
4. Set **Scope** to the name of the Azure subscription, and select the two regions in the allowed list.

    ![Policy allowed regions](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/policy-region.png)

5. By default the policy is set with **Deny**, meaning that if someone starts a deployment in the subscription that isn't in EUS2 or CUS, the deployment will fail. Here's what happens if someone in the Contoso subscription tries to set up a deployment in West US.

    ![Policy failed](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/policy-failed.png)

#### Allow specific VM SKUs

Contoso will use the built-in policy definition **Allow virtual machines SKUs** to limit the type of VMs that can be created in the subscription. 

![Policy SKU](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/policy-sku.png)



#### Check policy compliance

Policies go into effect immediately, and Contoso can check resources for compliance. 

1. In the Azure portal, click the **Compliance** link.
2. The compliance dashboard appears. You can drill down for further details.

    ![Policy compliance](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/policy-compliance.png)


### Set up locks

Contoso has long been using the ITIL framework for the management of their systems. One of the most important aspects of the framework is change control, and Contoso wants to make sure that change control is implemented in their Azure deployment.

Contoso is going to implement locks as follows:

- Any production or failover component must be in a resource group that has a ReadOnly lock.  This means that to modify or delete production items, the lock must be removed. 
- Non-production resource groups will have CanNotDelete locks. This means that authorized users can read or modify a resource, but can't delete it.

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources) about locks.

### Set up tagging

To track resources as they're added, it will be increasingly important for Contoso to associate resources with an appropriate department, customer, and environment. 

In addition to providing information about resources and owners, tags will enable Contoso to aggregate and group resources, and to use that data for chargeback purposes.

Contoso needs to visualize their Azure assets in a way that makes sense for their business. For example but role or department. Note that resources don't need to reside in the same resource group to share a tag. To do this, Contoso will create a simple tag taxonomy so that everyone's using the same tags.

**Tag name** | **Value**
--- | ---
CostCenter | 12345: It must be a valid cost center from SAP.
BusinessUnit | Name of business unit (from SAP). Matches CostCenter.
ApplicationTeam | Email alias of the team that owns support for the app.
CatalogName | Name of the app or ShareServices, per the service catalog that the resource supports.
ServiceManager | Email alias of the ITIL Service Manager for the resource.
COBPriority | Priority set by the business for BCDR. Values of 1-5.
ENV | DEV, STG, PROD are the possible values. Representing developing, staging, and production.

For example: 

 ![Azure tags](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/azure-tag.png)

After creating the tag, Contoso will go back and create new Azure policy definitions and assignments, to enforce the use of the required tags across the organization.


## Step 6: Consider security

Security is crucial in the cloud, and Azure provides a wide array of security tools and capabilities. These help you to create secure solutions, on the secure Azure platform. Read [Confidence in the trusted cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/) to learn more about Azure security.

There a few main aspects for Contoso to consider:

- **Azure Security Center**: Azure Security Center provides unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. With Security Center, you can apply security policies across your workloads, limit your exposure to threats, and detect and respond to attacks.  [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-intro).
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: An NSG is a filter (firewall) that contains a list of security rules which, when applied, allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to Azure VNets. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).
- **Data encryption**: Azure Disk Encryption is a capability that helps you encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine disks. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-encryption-atrest).

### Work with the Azure Security Center

Contoso is looking for a quick view into the security posture of their new hybrid cloud and specifically their Azure workloads.  As a result, Contoso has decided to implement Azure Security Center starting with the following features: 

- Centralized policy management
- Continuous assessment
- Actionable recommendations 

#### Centralize policy management

With centralized policy management, Contoso will ensure compliance with security requirements by centrally managing security policies across their entire environment. They can simply and quickly implement a policy which applies to all of their Azure resources.

![Security policy](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/security-policy.png)

#### Assess and action

Contoso will leverage the continuous security assessment which monitors the security of machines, networks, storage, data, and applications; to discover potential security issues. 

- Security Center will analyze the security state of Contoso’s compute, infrastructure, and data resources, and of Azure apps and services.
- Continuous assessment helps the Contoso operations team to discover potential security issues, such as systems with missing security updates or exposed network ports. 
- In particular Contoso wants to make sure all of their VMs are protected. Security Center helps with this, verifying VM health, and making prioritized and actionable recommendations to remediate security vulnerabilities before they're exploited.

![Monitoring](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/monitoring.png)

### Work with NSGs

Contoso can limit network traffic to resources in a virtual network using network security groups.

- A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- When applied to a subnet, rules are applied to all resources in the subnet. In addition to network interfaces, this includes instances of Azure services deployed in the subnet.
- Application security groups (ASGs) enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an app structure, allowing you to group VMs and define network security policies based on those groups.
    - App security groups mean that you can reuse your security policy at scale, without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses. The platform handles the complexity of explicit IP addresses and multiple rule sets, allowing you to focus on your business logic.
    - You can specify an application security group as the source and destination in a security rule. After your security policy is defined, you can create VMs, and assign the VM NICs to a group. 


Contoso will implement a mix of NSGs and ASGs. They are concerned about NSG management. They're worried about overuse of NSGs, and the complexity it might mean for their operations staff.  With this in mind, they have adopted two key principals that they use a general rule:

- All traffic into and out of all subnets (north-south), will be subject to an NSG rule, except for the GatewaySubnets in the Hub networks.
- Any firewalls or domain controller will be protected by both subnet NSGs and NIC NSGs.
- All production applications will have ASGs applied.


Contoso has built a model of how this will look for their applications.

![Security](./media/contoso-migration-infrastructure/asg.png)


The NSGs associated with the ASGs will be configured with least privilege to ensure that only allowed packets can flow from one part of the network to its destination.

**Action** | **Name** | **Source** | **Target** | **Port**
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Allow | AllowiInternetToFE | VNET-HUB-EUS1/IB-TrustZone | APP1-FE 80, 443
Allow | AllowWebToApp | APP1-FE | APP1-DB | 1433
Allow | AllowAppToDB | APP1-APP | Any | Any
Deny | DenyAllInbound | Any | Any | Any

### Encrypt data

Azure Disk Encryption integrates with Azure Key Vault to help control and manage the disk-encryption keys and secrets in a key vault subscription. It ensures that all data on VM disks are encrypted at rest in Azure storage.  

- Contoso has determined that specific VMs require encryption.
- They're going to apply encryption to VMs with customer, confidential, or PPI data.


## Conclusion

In this article, Contoso set up an Azure infrastructure and policy for Azure subscription, hybrid identify, disaster recovery, networking, governance, and security. 

Not all of the steps that Contoso completed here are required for a migration to the cloud. In their case, they wanted to plan a network infrastructure that can be used for all types of migrations, and is secure, resilient, and scalable. 

With this infrastructure in place, they're ready to move on and try out migration.

## Next steps

As a first migration scenario, Contoso is going to [assess the on-premises SmartHotel two-tiered app for migration to Azure](contoso-migration-assessment.md).
