# Guidance: Azure subscription design 

In the [what is an Azure subscription](subscription-explainer.md) explainer article, you learned that organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and impose limits on the creation of resources by users, teams, projects, or other strategies. These strategies will be discussed in more detail in the intermediate and advanced adoption stage articles.

However, a single subscription is sufficient to contain the resources you'll create during the foundational stage. You can create this subscription by following the guide to [licensing Azure for the enterprise][azure-enterprise-licensing].

## Next steps

* Now that you've learned about subscriptions and created your first one, learn more about creating and managing resources in the [resource management in Azure](resource-manager-explainer.md) explainer article.
