# Plan for deploying serverless Functions

To plan for moving an application to a serverless Azure Functions architecture, a technical decision maker (TDM) or architect:
- Verifies the application's characteristics and business requirements.
- Determines the application's suitability for serverless Azure Functions.
- Transforms business requirements into functional and other requirements.

Planning activities also include assessing technical team readiness, providing or attending workshops and training, and conducting architectural design reviews, proofs of concept, pilots, and technical implementations.

TDMs and architects may perform one or more of the following activities:

- **Execute an application assessment.** Evaluate the main aspects of the application to determine how complex and risky it is to rearchitect through application modernization, or rebuild a new cloud-native application. See [Application assessment](application-assessment.md).

- **Attend or promote technical workshops and training.** Host a Serverless workshop or CloudHack, or enjoy many other training and learning opportunities for serverless technologies, Azure Functions, app modernization, and cloud-native apps. See [Technical workshops and training](technical-training.md).

- **Identify and execute a Proof of Concept (PoC) or pilot, or technical implementation.** Deliver a PoC, pilot, or technical implementation to provide evidence that serverless Azure Functions can solve a team's business problems. Showing teams how to modernize or build new cloud-native applications to their specifications can accelerate deployment to production. See [PoC or pilot](poc-pilot.md).

- **Conduct architectural design sessions.** An architectural design session (ADS) is an in-depth discussion on how a new solution will blend into the environment. ADSs validate business requirements and transform them to functional and other requirements.

## Next steps
For example scenarios that use serverless architectures with Azure Functions, see [Serverless reference architectures](reference-architectures.md).

To move forward with serverless Azure Functions implementation, see the following resources:

- [Application development and deployment](application-development.md)
- [Azure Functions app operations](functions-app-operations.md)
- [Azure Functions app security](functions-app-security.md)
