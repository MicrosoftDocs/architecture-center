# The code-with engineering playbook

Everyone owns their code and has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great. The [Code-With Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook) by the Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team is a good guide to best engineering practices. 

Code with Microsoft teams, partners, and customers to help them successfully:

- Deliver technical implementations.
- Modernize or build new apps to specifications.
- Accelerate deployments to production.
- Scale implementations to other parts of workloads.
- Operate, optimize, secure, and manage apps and workloads.

The Engineering Playbook shows how to increase engineering team efficiency, reduce mistakes and common pitfalls, and strive to be better engineers. Engineering best practices for serverless and Azure Functions include:

- Keep the code quality bar high.
- Value quality and precision over just "getting things done."
- Work diligently on the one important thing.
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
- Ship incremental customer value.
- Avoid adding scope to a backlog item. Instead, add a new backlog item.
- Keep backlog items up to date to communicate status with your team and stakeholders.
- As a distributed team, take time to share context via wikis, Teams, and backlog items.
- Report product issues, and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback.
- Learn from other people's shared experiences and feedback.
