# Azure for AWS professionals

This series of articles helps Amazon Web Services (AWS) experts understand the basics of Microsoft Azure accounts, platform, and services. These articles also cover key similarities and differences between AWS and Azure. Whether you are planning a multicloud solution with Azure and AWS or migrating to Azure, you can compare the capabilities of Azure and AWS services in all categories.

These articles describe:

- How to think about Azure capabilities coming from an AWS background.
- How Azure organizes accounts and resources.
- How the major Azure services differ from AWS services or how they are similar.

Use the table of contents to select specific technology areas that are relevant to your workload. These articles compare services that are roughly comparable. Not every AWS service or Azure service is listed, and not every matched service has exact feature-for-feature parity.

## Similarities and differences

Like AWS, Azure builds on a core set of AI, compute, storage, database, and networking services. In many cases, the platforms offer similar products and services. For example, both AWS and Azure can use Linux distributions and open-source software technologies. Both platforms support building highly available solutions on Windows or Linux hosts.

While the capabilities of both platforms are similar, the resources that provide those capabilities are often organized differently. Azure and AWS built their capabilities independently over time, so the platforms have important implementation and design differences. For instance, AWS relies heavily on AWS accounts to serve as a logical boundary for things like applying permissions or tracking spend. Azure has subscriptions which are similar to AWS accounts, it also and resource groups are used to logically group and manage resources at a more granular level.

Exact one-to-one correspondences between the services that you need to build a solution aren't always clear. Sometimes, only one of the platforms offers a particular service. 

## Primary topics
