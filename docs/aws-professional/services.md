# Azure & AWS Cloud Service Map

This document defines how common cloud services are made available via Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We hope that this guide helps developers understand the services that Azure offers, whether they are new to the cloud or just new to Azure. We’ve structured the guide using a table that explains each cloud service capability sorted by service popularity, and maps the capability to the service offering name for both Azure and AWS. In the following tables, there are multiple Azure services listed for some AWS services. The Azure services are similar to one another, but depth and breadth of capabilities vary.

## Azure and AWS for Multicloud Solutions

As the leading public cloud platforms, Azure and AWS each offer businesses a broad and deep set of capabilities with global coverage. Yet many organizations choose to use both platforms together for greater choice and flexibility, as well as to spread their risk and dependencies with a multicloud approach. Consulting companies and software vendors might also build on and use both Azure and AWS, as these platforms represent most of the cloud market demand.

For an overview of Azure for AWS users, see [Introduction to Azure for AWS experts](index.md).
