# Messaging services on Azure and AWS

## Simple Email Service

AWS provides the Simple Email Service (SES) for sending notification, transactional, or marketing emails. In Azure, third-party solutions like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/partners/azure) provide email services.

## Simple Queueing Service

AWS Simple Queueing Service (SQS) provides a messaging system for connecting applications, services, and devices within the AWS platform. Azure has two services that provide similar functionality:

- [Queue storage](/azure/storage/queues/storage-nodejs-how-to-use-queues): a cloud messaging service that allows communication between application components within Azure.

- [Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus): a more robust messaging system for connecting applications, services, and devices. Using the related [Service Bus relay](/azure/service-bus-relay/relay-what-is-it), Service Bus can also connect to remotely hosted applications and services.
