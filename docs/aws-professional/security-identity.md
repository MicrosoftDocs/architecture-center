# Compare AWS and Azure identity management solutions

This guide is for organizations that use Amazon Web Services (AWS) and want to migrate to Azure or adopt a multicloud strategy. This guidance compares AWS identity management solutions to similar Azure solutions.

> [!TIP]
> For information about extending Microsoft Entra ID into AWS, see [Microsoft Entra identity management and access management for AWS](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/aws/aws-azure-ad-security).

## Core identity services

Core identity services in both platforms form the foundation of identity and access management. These services include core authentication, authorization, and accounting capabilities, and the ability to organize cloud resources into logical structures. AWS professionals can use similar capabilities in Azure. These capabilities might have architectural differences in implementation.

| AWS service | Azure service | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) | Centralized identity management service that provides single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and integration with various applications|
| [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) | [Azure management groups](/azure/governance/management-groups/overview) | Hierarchical organization structure to manage multiple accounts and subscriptions by using inherited policies |
| [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | [Microsoft Entra ID SSO](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on) | Centralized access management that enables users to access multiple applications by using a single set of credentials |
| [AWS Directory Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html) | [Microsoft Entra Domain Services](/entra/identity/domain-services/overview) | Managed directory services that provide domain join, group policy, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos or NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication |

## Authentication and access control

Authentication and access control services in both platforms provide essential security features to verify user identities and manage resource access. These services handle MFA, access reviews, external user management, and role-based permissions.

| AWS service | Azure service | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| [AWS MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) | [Microsoft Entra MFA](/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) | Extra security layer that requires multiple forms of verification for user sign-ins |
| [AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) | [Microsoft Entra access reviews](/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview) | Tools and services to review and manage access permissions to resources |
| [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | [Microsoft Entra External ID](/entra/external-id/external-identities-overview) | External user access management platform for secure cross-organization collaboration. These platforms support protocols like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC). |
| [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | [Microsoft Entra role-based access control (RBAC)](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview) and [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) | Services that can share cloud resources within an organization. AWS typically shares cloud resources across multiple accounts. Azure RBAC can achieve similar resource sharing.  |

## Identity governance

To maintain security and compliance, you must manage identities and access. Both AWS and Azure provide solutions for identity governance. Organizations and workload teams can use these solutions to manage the lifecycle of identities, conduct access reviews, and control privileged access.

In AWS, managing the identity lifecycle, access reviews, and privileged access requires a combination of several services.

- AWS IAM handles secure access to resources.
- IAM Access Analyzer helps identify shared resources.
- AWS Organizations provides centralized management of multiple accounts.
- IAM Identity Center provides centralized access management.
- AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config enable governance, compliance, and auditing of AWS resources.

You can tailor these services to meet specific organizational needs, which helps ensure compliance and security.

In Azure, [Microsoft Entra ID Governance](/entra/id-governance/identity-governance-overview) provides an integrated solution to manage the identity lifecycle, access reviews, and privileged access. It simplifies these processes by incorporating automated workflows, access certifications, and policy enforcement. These capabilities provide a unified approach to identity governance.

## Privileged access management

AWS IAM temporary elevated access is an open-source security solution that grants temporary elevated access to AWS resources via AWS IAM Identity Center. This approach ensures that users only have elevated privileges for a limited time and for specific tasks to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

[Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) provides just-in-time privileged access management. You use PIM to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources and critical permissions in your organization. PIM includes features such as role activation via approval workflows, time-bound access, and access reviews to ensure that privileged roles are only granted when necessary and are fully audited.


| AWS service | Azure service | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) | [Microsoft Entra privileged access audit](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-use-audit-log) | Comprehensive audit logging for privileged access activities |
| [AWS IAM and partner products or custom automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/temporary-elevated-access.html) | [Microsoft Entra just-in-time access](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) | Time-bound privileged role activation process |

## Hybrid identity

Both platforms provide solutions to manage hybrid identity scenarios that integrate cloud and on-premises resources.

| AWS service | Azure service | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| [AWS Directory Service AD Connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_ad_connector.html) | [Microsoft Entra Connect](/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/whatis-azure-ad-connect) | Directory synchronization tool for hybrid identity management |

| [AWS Managed Microsoft AD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html) | [Microsoft Entra password hash synchronization](/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/whatis-phs) | Password synchronization between on-premises and cloud instances |

## Application and API user authentication and authorization

Both platforms provide identity services to secure application access and API authentication. These services manage user authentication, application permissions, and API access controls through identity-based mechanisms. The [Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/) serves as the Azure unified framework for authentication and authorization across applications, APIs, and services. It implements standards like OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. AWS provides similar capabilities through [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as part of its identity suite.

| AWS service | Microsoft service | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
|[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) <br><br> [AWS Amplify Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/authentication/) <br><br> [AWS Security Token Service (STS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) |[Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) | Comprehensive identity platform that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for applications and APIs.
