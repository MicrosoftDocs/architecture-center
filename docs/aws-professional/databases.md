# Database technologies on Azure and AWS

## RDS and Azure relational database services

Azure provides several different relational database services that are the equivalent of AWS' Relational Database Service (RDS).

- [SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview)
- [Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/overview)
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/overview)
- [Azure Database for MariaDB](/azure/mariadb/overview)

Other database engines such as [SQL Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server), [Oracle](https://azure.microsoft.com/campaigns/oracle), and [MySQL](/azure/mysql/) can be deployed using Azure VM Instances.

Costs for AWS RDS are determined by the amount of hardware resources that your instance uses, like CPU, RAM, storage, and network bandwidth. In the Azure database services, cost depends on your database size, concurrent connections, and throughput levels.

## Analytics and big data

Azure provides a package of products and services designed to capture, organize, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data consisting of the following services:

- [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/hdinsight): managed Apache distribution that includes Hadoop, Spark, Storm, or HBase.

- [Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/data-factory): provides data orchestration and data pipeline functionality.

- [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/): large-scale relational data storage using either serverless or dedicated resources.
- [Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/): a unified analytics platform for data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.

- [Data Lake Store](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/data-lake-store): analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. Query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resourcesâ€”at scale.

- [Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/machine-learning): used to build and apply predictive analytics on data.

- [Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/stream-analytics): real-time data analysis.

- [Data Lake Analytics](/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-overview): large-scale analytics service optimized to work with Data Lake Store
