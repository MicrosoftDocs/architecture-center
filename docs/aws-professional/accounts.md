# Azure and AWS accounts and subscriptions

Azure services can be purchased using several pricing options, depending on your organization's size and needs. See the [pricing overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing) page for details.

[Azure subscriptions](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/infrastructure-example) are a grouping of resources with an assigned owner responsible for billing and permissions management. Unlike AWS, where any resources created under the AWS account are tied to that account, subscriptions exist independently of their owner accounts, and can be reassigned to new owners as needed.

Subscriptions are assigned three types of administrator accounts:

- **Account Administrator**. The subscription owner and the account billed for the resources used in the subscription. The account administrator can only be changed by transferring ownership of the subscription.

- **Service Administrator**. This account has rights to create and manage resources in the subscription, but is not responsible for billing. By default, the account administrator and service administrator are assigned to the same account. The account administrator can assign a separate user to the service administrator account for managing the technical and operational aspects of a subscription. Only one service administrator is assigned per subscription.

- **Co-administrator**. There can be multiple co-administrator accounts assigned to a subscription. Co-administrators cannot change the service administrator, but otherwise have full control over subscription resources and users.

Below the subscription level user roles and individual permissions can also be assigned to specific resources, similarly to how permissions are granted to IAM users and groups in AWS. In Azure, all user accounts are associated with either a Microsoft Account or Organizational Account (an account managed through an Azure Active Directory).

Like AWS accounts, subscriptions have default service quotas and limits. For a full list of these limits, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits).
These limits can be increased up to the maximum by [filing a support request in the management portal](/archive/blogs/girishp/increasing-core-quota-limits-in-azure).
