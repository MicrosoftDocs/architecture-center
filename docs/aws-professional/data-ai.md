# Data and AI

This article compares core Azure data and AI services to corresponding Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions.

For comparison of other Azure and AWS services, see [Azure for AWS professionals](./index.md).

## Data governance, management, and platforms

Both Microsoft Purview and the combination of AWS services described in the following table provide comprehensive data governance solutions. Use these solutions to manage, discover, classify, and secure your data assets.

| AWS services   | Microsoft service  | Description      |
| --- |------- |--|
| [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/), [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/), [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) | [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview/) | Both options provide data governance, cataloging, and compliance features. Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance solution. You can use it to discover, classify, and manage data across on-premises, multicloud, and software as a service (SaaS) environments. It also provides data lineage and compliance capabilities. AWS provides similar functionalities with multiple services: [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) for metadata management, [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) for data lake creation and governance, [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) for data classification and protection, [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for access control, and [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) for configuration management and compliance tracking. |

## All-in-one platform vs. AWS services

Microsoft Fabric provides an all-in-one platform that unifies the data and AI services required for modern analytics solutions. It moves data efficiently between services, provides unified governance and security, and simplifies pricing models. This approach contrasts with the AWS approach, where you often use separate services and must invest more effort in integration. Fabric provides integration across these functions within the Azure ecosystem.

Both AWS and Fabric provide capabilities for data integration, processing, analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.

| AWS service | Microsoft service | Description |
|--|------|--|
| [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) | [Fabric data integration with Azure Data Factory](/fabric/data-factory/) | AWS Glue provides capabilities to build data and analytics solutions. This approach provides flexibility but requires more effort to integrate each service into an end-to-end solution. Fabric combines capabilities within a single platform to simplify workflows, collaboration, and management. |
