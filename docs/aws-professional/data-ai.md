# Data and AI

This article compares the core Azure data and AI services to the corresponding Amazon Web Services (AWS) services.

For comparison of other AWS and Azure services, see [Azure for AWS professionals](./index.md).

## Data governance, management, and platforms

Both Microsoft Purview and the combination of AWS services described in the following table aim to provide comprehensive data governance solutions. These solutions enable organizations to effectively manage, discover, classify, and provide security for their data assets.

| Microsoft service  | AWS services   | Description      |
| ------- |--- |--|
| [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview/) | [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/), [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/), [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) | Both options provide robust data governance, cataloging, and compliance features. Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance solution that allows organizations to discover, classify, and manage data across on-premises, multicloud, and SaaS environments. It also provides data lineage and compliance capabilities. AWS provides similar functionalities with multiple services: [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) for metadata management, [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) for data lake creation and governance, [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) for data classification and protection, [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for access control, and [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) for configuration management and compliance tracking. |

## All-in-one platform vs. AWS services

Microsoft Fabric provides an all-in-one platform that unifies the data and AI services required for modern analytics solutions. It streamlines the process of moving data between services, provides unified governance and security, and simplifies pricing models. This unified approach contrasts with the AWS approach, in which services are often used separately and require more effort to integrate. Fabric provides seamless integration across these functions that can help your organization accelerate your data-driven initiatives in the Azure ecosystem.

Both AWS and Fabric provide services for data integration, processing, analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.

| AWS services | Fabric | Description          |
|  --| ------  |  -- |
| [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [AWS Data Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/what-is-datapipeline.html) | [Data integration with Azure Data Factory](/fabric/data-factory/) | AWS provides a suite of individual services that can be combined to build data and analytics solutions. This approach provides flexibility but requires more effort to integrate the services into an end-to-end solution. Fabric provides these capabilities within a single unified platform to simplify workflows, collaboration, and management. |
