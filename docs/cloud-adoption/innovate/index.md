# Innovation in the Cloud Adoption Framework

The cloud creates new opportunities for customers to innovate.

> [!NOTE]
> In Q3 2019, the Cloud Adoption Framework will expand to include guidance regarding modernization and cloud-native approaches to driving innovation across the digital estate and application portfolio.

## Application modernization and innovation

Cloud-native apps and data accelerate development and experimentation cycles. Older apps can take advantage of many of the same cloud-native benefits by modernizing the solution or components of the solution. Modern DevOps and SDLC approaches that use cloud technology shorten the time from idea to product change. Combined, these tools invite the customer into the process to create shorter feedback loops and better customer experiences.

## Data platform modernization and innovation

The cloud enables new forms of data within common platforms. Increasing velocity, veracity, variety, and volume of data allows data professionals to develop insights and predictions across broader data sets. Expanded ingression tools, like IoT and Azure Data Factory, allow broader teams to integrate data bidirectionally with physical and virtual products.

## Infrastructure modernization and innovation

Modern approaches to infrastructure deployment, operations, and governance are rapidly bridging the gaps between development and operations. Establishing environment factories with common templates for various application patterns allows IT and operations teams to accelerate deployment while reducing risks. Integration of operations frees DevOps from maintenance of configuration drift, security baseline implementation, operational monitoring, and other IT services. Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio produces tighter alignment with DevOps, accelerating innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.
