# Planning for cloud adoption

To be successful in cloud adoption, a plan is an essential requirement. A cloud adoption plan is an iterative project plan that is designed to help companies transition from traditional IT approaches in favor of modern, agile approaches to transformation. As this article series will outline, a cloud adoption plan helps companies balance their IT portfolio and manage transitions over time. Through this process, business objectives can be clearly translated into tangible technical efforts. Those efforts can then be managed and communicated in ways that resonate with business stakeholders. However, adopting such a process may require some adjustments to traditional project management approaches.

## Aligning strategy and planning

Cloud adoption plans start with a well-defined strategy. At minimum, the strategy should outline the motivations, business outcomes, and business justifications for cloud adoption. Those positive returns are then balanced by the effort required to realize those returns. The effort starts with the digital estate (proposed or existing) which translates the strategy into more tangible workloads and assets, which can then be mapped to technical work. From there, the technical work can be executed by skilled people in a proper organizational structure. The cloud adoption plan consolidates all of these topics into one plan that can be forecasted, budgeted, implemented, and managed through agile project management practices. This article series will help build the plan and provide a few templates to make the job easier.

## Transition from sequential to iterative planning

However, planning for cloud adoption can be a paradigm shift for some organizations. IT project management has long focused on the application of linear or sequential models of project management, like [waterfall models to project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). In traditional IT, this approach was entirely logical. Most large IT projects started with a procurement ask to acquire expensive hardware resources. Capital expense requests, budget allocations, and equipment acquisition often times represented a large percentage of project execution. Further, once acquired the hardware became a limiting constraint on what could or could not be delivered.

The acquisition models of the cloud change the core dependencies that made a sequential model necessary. Removal of acquisition cycles in favor of operating expense approaches allows businesses to move more quickly, with smaller financial commitments. This approach allows teams to engage in projects before all of the requirements are well known. Further, it creates room for a growth mindset, which frees the team to experiment, learn, and deliver without artificial constraints. For all of these reasons and more, it is highly suggested that teams leverage agile or iterative approaches to cloud adoption planning.

## Building your cloud adoption plan

This article series will walk through each step of translating the strategy and effort into the actionable plan, as follows:

1. **Prerequisites:** Confirm that all of the prerequisite steps have been completed prior to creating a plan.
2. **Define and prioritize workloads:** Prioritize your first 10 workloads to establish an initial adoption backlog.
3. **Align assets:** Identify which assets (proposed or existing) are required to support the prioritized workloads.
4. **Review rationalization:** Review rationalization decisions to refine adoption path decisions: Migrate or Innovate.
5. **Define iterations and releases:** Iterations are the time blocks allocated to perform work. Releases are the definition of what work should be done before triggering a change to production processes.
6. **Estimate timelines:** Based on initial estimates, establish rough timelines for release planning purposes.
