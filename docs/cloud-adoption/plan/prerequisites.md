# Prerequisites checklist for an effective cloud adoption plan

A plan is only as effective as the data being input into the plan. For a cloud adoption plan to be effective, there are two categories of inputs: strategic inputs and tactical inputs. The following outlines the minimum data points required in each category.

## Strategic inputs

Accurate strategic inputs ensure that the work being performed contributes to successful realization of business outcomes. The [strategy section of the Cloud Adoption Framework](../business-strategy/index.md) provides a series of exercises to develop a clear strategy. The outputs of those exercises will feed the cloud adoption plan. Before developing the plan, ensure the following are well-defined as a result of those exercises:

- **Clear motivations:** Why are we adopting the cloud?
- **Defined business outcomes:** What results to we expect to see from adoption the cloud?
- **Business justification:** How will the business measure success?

Every member of the team implementing the cloud adoption plan should be able to answer these three strategic questions. Managers and leaders who hold accountability for the implementation of this plan should understand the metrics behind each question and any progress towards realizing those metrics.

## Tactical inputs

Accurate tactical inputs ensure that the work being performed can be accurately planned and effectively managed. Prior to building the actual plan, the [plan section of the Cloud Adoption Framework](./index.md) provides a series of exercises to develop planning artifacts. Those artifacts should provide answers to the following questions prior to creating a plan:

- **Digital estate rationalization:** What are the top 10 priority workloads in the adoption plan? How many additional workloads are likely to be in the plan? How many assets are being considered as candidates for cloud adoption? Are the initial efforts focused more on migration or innovation activities?
- **Organization alignment:** Who will be performing the technical work in the adoption plan? Who is accountable for maintaining adherence to governance and compliance requirements?
- **Skills readiness:** How many people are allocated to perform the required tasks? How well are their skills aligned to cloud adoption efforts? Are partners aligned to support the technical implementation?

These questions will be essential to the accuracy of the cloud adoption plan. At minimum, the questions to digital estate rationalization must be answered to create a plan. To provide accurate timelines, the questions regarding organization and skills will become extremely important.

## Next steps

Once the team is comfortable with the strategic inputs and digital estate rationalization inputs, the next step of [workload prioritization](./workloads.md) can begin.
