# Initial organization alignment

The most important aspect of any cloud adoption plan, is the alignment of people who will make the plan a reality. No plan is complete until you understand the people aspects.

True organizational alignment takes time. It will become important to land on long-term organizational alignment, especially as cloud adoption scales across the business and IT culture. It is so important, that an entire section of guidance has been dedicated to [organization alignment](../organization/index.md) within the operate section of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

Full organization alignment is not a required component of the cloud adoption plan. However, some initial organization alignment is needed. The following article outlines a best practice starting point for organizational alignment. This guidance can help complete your plan and get your teams ready for cloud adoption. When you are ready, the [organization alignment](../organization/index.md) section can be used to customize the following guidance to fit your organization.

## Initial best practice structure

To create balance between speed and control, Microsoft suggests a minimum of two parties be assigned accountability during cloud adoption: Cloud Adoption and Cloud Governance. Each of these parties may be represented by a team of people sharing responsibilities for each capability. They could also be represented by individual people who are both accountable for the outcomes and responsible for the work. In either scenario, cloud adoption and cloud governance are two capabilities that create natural friction between moving quickly, and reducing risks. The following image illustrates how the two teams fit together.

It's fairly intuitive that cloud adoption tasks will require the support of people to execute those tasks. As such, few people are surprised when the thought of a cloud adoption team is introduced as a requirement. However, people who are new to the cloud may not fully appreciate the importance of a cloud governance team. Especially early in adoption cycles. The cloud governance team provides the necessary checks and balances to ensure that cloud adoption doesn't expose the business to any new risks. When risks are essential, this team ensures the proper processes and controls are implemented to mitigate or govern those risks.

You can learn more about cloud adoption, cloud governance, or other required capabilities in this brief section on [understanding require cloud capabilities](../organization/index.md?#understand-required-cloud-capabilities).

## Map people to capabilities

Assuming the suggested structure aligns to your cloud adoption plan, the next step is to map specific people to the necessary capabilities. To do so, answer the following questions:

- What person (or group of people) will be responsible for completing technical tasks in the cloud adoption plan?
- What person will be held accountability for the team's ability to deliver on the technical change?
- What person (or group of people) will be responsible for implementing governance protection mechanisms?
- What person will be held accountability for the defining those governance controls?
- Are there other capabilities or people that will have accountability or responsibility within the cloud adoption plan?

## Next steps

Once the answers to these questions are documented, continue to the [skills readiness article](./adapt-roles-skills-processes.md) to define plans for preparing these people for the work to come.
