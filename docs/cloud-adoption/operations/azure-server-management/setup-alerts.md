# Set up basic alerts

A key part of managing resources is getting notified when problems occur. Alerts proactively notify you of critical conditions. They can be based on triggers from metrics, logs, or service health issues. As part of onboarding the Azure server management services, you can set up alerts and notifications that can help keep your IT teams aware of any problems.

## Azure Monitor alerts

Azure Monitor offers [alerting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview) capabilities to notify you via email or messaging when things go wrong. These capabilities are based on a common data monitoring platform that includes logs and metrics generated by your servers and other resources. This platform allows you to analyze data combined from multiple resources by using a common set of tools in Azure Monitor, which you can use to trigger alerts. These triggers can include:

- Metric values.
- Log search queries.
- Activity Log events.
- Health of the underlying Azure platform.
- Tests for website availability.

See the [list of Azure Monitor data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources) for a more detailed description of the sources of monitoring data that's collected by this service.

For details on manually creating and managing alerts by using the portal, see the [Azure Monitor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric).

## Automated deployment of recommended alerts

In this guide, we recommend that you enable a set of 15 alerts for basic infrastructure monitoring. You can find the deployment scripts in the [Azure Alert toolkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/manageability-toolkits).

This package creates alerts for low disk space, low available memory, high CPU utilization, unexpected shutdowns, corrupted file systems, and common hardware failures. The package uses HP server hardware as an example. You should change the settings in the associated configuration file to reflect your OEM hardware. You can also add more performance counters to the configuration file. To deploy the package, run the New-CoreAlerts.ps1 file.
