# Cloud monitoring guide: Overview of our monitoring platforms

Microsoft provides a range of monitoring capabilities from two products: System Center Operations Manager which was designed for on-premises and then extended to the cloud and Azure Monitor, which was designed for the cloud but can also monitor on-premises systems. These two offerings deliver core monitoring services, such as alerting, service uptime tracking, application and infrastructure health monitoring, diagnostics, and analytics.

Many organizations are embracing the latest practices for DevOps agility and cloud innovations to manage their heterogenous environments. Yet they are also concerned about their ability to make appropriate and responsible decisions regarding how to monitor those workloads.

This article provides a high-level overview of our monitoring platforms to help you understand how both deliver core monitoring functionality.

## Story of System Center Operations Manager

In 2000, we entered the operations management field with Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) 2000. In 2007, we introduced a re-engineered version of the product named System Center Operations Manager. It moved beyond simple monitoring of a Windows server and concentrated on robust, end-to-end service and application monitoring, including heterogenous platforms, network devices, and other application or service dependencies. It's an established, enterprise-grade monitoring platform for on-premises environments, in the same class as IBM Tivoli or HP Operations Manager in the industry. It has evolved to support monitoring compute and platform resources running in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and other cloud providers. 

## Story of Azure Monitor

When Azure was released in 2010, monitoring of cloud services was provided with the Azure Diagnostics agent, which delivered a way to collect diagnostic data from Azure resources. This capability was considered a general monitoring tool vs an enterprise-class monitoring platform.  

Application Insights was introduced to shift with changes in the industry where proliferation of cloud, mobile and IoT devices was growing and the introduction of DevOps practices. It evolved from Application Performance Monitoring in Operations Manager to a service in Azure, where it delivers rich monitoring of web applications written in a variety of languages. In 2015, the preview of Application Insights for Visual Studio was announced and later, it became known just as Application Insights. It collects details on application performance, requests and exceptions, and traces.

In 2015, Azure Operational Insights was made generally available. It delivered the Log Analytics analysis service that collected and searched data from machines in Azure, on-prem or other cloud environments, and connected to System Center Operations Manager. Intelligence packs were offered that delivered different pre-packaged management and monitoring configurations that contained a collection of query and analytic logic, visualizations, and data collection rules for such scenarios as security auditing, health assessments, and alert management.  Later Azure Operational Insights became known as Log Analytics.  

In 2016, the preview of Azure Monitor was announced Ignite. It provided a common framework to collect platform metrics, resource diagnostics logs, and subscription-level activity log events from any Azure service that started using the framework. Previously, each Azure service had its own monitoring method.

At Microsoft Ignite conference in 2018, we announced that the Azure Monitor brand expanded to include several different services originally developed with independent functionality:

* The original **Azure Monitor** functionality of collecting platform metrics, resource diagnostics logs, and activity logs for only Azure platform resources.
* **Application Insights** for application monitoring. 
* **Log Analytics** as the primary location for collection and analysis of log data. 
* A new **unified alerting service** that brought together alert mechanisms from each of the other services mentioned earlier.  
* **Azure Network Watcher** to monitor, diagnose, and view metrics for resources in an Azure virtual network.

## Story of Operations Management Suite (OMS)

From 2015 until April 2018, Operations Management Suite (OMS) was a bundling of the following Azure management services for licensing purposes:

* Application Insights
* Azure Automation
* Azure Backup
* Operational Insights (later the rebranded Log Analytics)
* Site Recovery

The functionality of the services that were part of OMS did not change when OMS was discontinued, they were realigned under Azure Monitor. 

## Infrastructure requirements

### Operations Manager

Operations Manager requires significant infrastructure and maintenance to support a management group, which is a basic unit of functionality. At a minimum, a management group consists of one or more management servers, a SQL Server, hosting the operational and reporting data warehouse database, and agents. The complexity of a management group design depends on a number of factors, such as the scope of workloads to monitor, and how many devices or computers support the workloads. If you require high availability and site resiliency, as is commonly the case with enterprise monitoring platforms, the infrastructure requirements and associated maintenance can increase dramatically.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a SaaS service, where all the infrastructure supporting it is running in Azure and is managed by Microsoft. It's designed to do monitoring, analytics, and diagnostics at scale, and is available in all national clouds. Core parts of the infrastructure (collectors, metrics and logs store, and analytics) necessary to support Azure Monitor are maintained by Microsoft.

## Data collection

### Operations Manager

#### Agents

Operations Manager only collects data directly from agents installed on [Windows computers](https://docs.microsoft.com//system-center/scom/plan-planning-agent-deployment?view=sc-om-1807#windows-agent). It can accept data from the Operations Manager SDK, but this is typically used for partners extending the product with custom applications, not for collecting monitoring data. It can collect data from other sources, such as [Linux computers](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/scom/plan-planning-agent-deployment?view=sc-om-1807#linuxunix-agent) and network devices, by using special modules that run on the Windows agent remotely accessing these other devices.

![Diagram of Operations Manager agent](./media/monitoring-management-guidance-cloud-and-on-premises/data-collection-opsman-agents-optimized.svg)

The Operations Manager agent can collect from multiple data sources on the local computer, such as the event log, custom logs, and performance counters. It can also run scripts, which can collect data from the local computer or from external sources. You can write custom scripts to collect data that can’t be collected by other means, or from a variety of remote devices that can’t otherwise be monitored.

#### Management packs

Operations Manager performs all monitoring with workflows (rules, monitors, and object discoveries). These are packaged together in a [management pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/scom/manage-overview-management-pack?view=sc-om-2019), and deployed to agents. Management packs are available for a variety of products and services that include predefined rules and monitors. You can also author your own management pack for your own applications and custom scenarios.

#### Monitoring configuration

Management packs can contain hundreds of rules, monitors, and object discovery rules. An agent runs all these monitoring settings from all the management packs that apply, which are determined by discovery rules. Each instance of each monitoring setting runs independently, and acts immediately on the data that it collects. This is how Operations Manager can achieve near real-time alerting and the current health state of monitored resources.

For example, a monitor might sample a performance counter every few minutes. If that counter exceeds a threshold, it immediately sets the health state of its target object, which immediately triggers an alert in the management group. A scheduled rule might watch for a particular event to be created, and immediately fire an alert when that event is created in the local event log.

Because these monitoring settings are isolated from each other and work from the individual sources of data, Operations Manager has challenges correlating data between multiple sources. It’s also difficult to react to data after it’s been collected. You can run workflows that access the Operations Manager database, but this scenario isn’t common and it's typically used for a limited number of special purpose workflows.

### Azure Monitor

#### Data sources

Azure Monitor collects data from a variety of sources, including Azure infrastructure and platform resources, agents on Windows and Linux computers, and monitoring data collected in Azure storage. Any REST client can write log data to Azure Monitor by using an API, and you can define custom metrics for your web applications. Some metric data can be routed to different locations, depending on its usage. For example, you might use the data for "fast-as-possible" alerting, or for long-term trend analysis searched in conjunction with other log data.

#### Monitoring solutions and insights

Monitoring solutions use the logs platform in Azure Monitor to provide monitoring for a particular application or service. They typically define data collection from agents or from Azure services, and provide log queries and views to analyze that data. They typically don’t provide alert rules, meaning that you must define your own alert criteria based on collected data.

Insights, such as Azure Monitor for containers and Azure Monitor for VMs, use the logs and metrics platform of Azure Monitor to provide a customized monitoring experience for an application or service in the Azure portal. They might provide health monitoring and alerting conditions, in addition to customized analysis of collected data.

#### Monitoring configuration

Azure Monitor separates data collection from actions taken against that data, which supports distributed microservices in a cloud environment. It consolidates data from multiple sources into a common data platform, and provides analysis, visualization, and alerting capabilities based on the collected data.

All data collected by Azure Monitor is stored as either logs or metrics, and different features of Monitor rely on either. Metrics contain numerical values in time series that are well suited for near real-time alerting and fast detection of issues. Logs contain text or numerical data, and are supported by a powerful query language that make them especially useful for performing complex analysis.

Because Monitor separates data collection from actions against that data, it might not be able to provide near real-time alerting in many cases. To alert on log data, queries are run on a recurring schedule defined in the alert. This behavior allows Azure Monitor to easily correlate data from all monitored sources, and you can interactively analyze data in a variety of ways. This is especially helpful for doing root cause analysis and identifying where else an issue may occur.

## Health monitoring

### Operations Manager

Management Packs in Operations Manager include a service model that describes the components of the application being monitored and their relationship. Monitors identify the current health state of each component based on data and scripts on the agent. Health states roll up so that you quickly view the summarized health state of monitored computers and applications.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor doesn’t provide a user definable method of implementing a service model or monitors that indicate the current health state of any service components. Because monitoring solutions are based on standard features of Azure Monitor, they don’t provide state level monitoring. The following features of Azure Monitor can be helpful:

- **Application Insights** builds a composite map of your web application, and provides a health state for each application component or dependency. This includes alerts status and drill-down to more detailed diagnostics of your application.

- **Azure Monitor for VMs** delivers a health monitoring experience for the guest Azure VMs, similar to Operations Manager, when monitoring Windows and Linux virtual machines. It evaluates the health of key operating system components from the perspective of availability and performance to determine the current health state. When it determines the guest VM is experiencing sustained resource utilization, disk space capacity, or an issue related to core operating system functionality, it generates an alert to bring this state to your attention.

- **Azure Monitor for containers** monitors the performance and health of Azure Kubernetes Services or Azure Container Instances. It collects memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers that are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. It also collects container logs, and inventory data about containers and their images. Pre-defined health criteria based on the performance data collected help you identify if there is a resource bottleneck or capacity issue. You can also understand the overall performance, or the performance from a specific Kubernetes object type (pod, node, controller, or container).

## Analyzing data

### Operations Manager

Operations Manager provides four basic ways to analyze data after it’s collected.

- With **Health Explorer**, you can find out which monitors are identifying a health state issue and review knowledge about the monitor and possible causes for actions related to it.

- **Views** are predefined visualizations of collected data, such as a graph of performance data or a list of monitored components and their current health state. Diagram views visually present the service model of an application.

- **Reports** allow you to summarize historical data stored in the Operations Manager data warehouse. You can customize the data that views and reports are based on. However, there is no feature to allow for complex or interactive analysis of collected data.

- **Operations Manager Command Shell**, which extends Windows PowerShell with an additional set of cmdlets, can query and visualize collected data. This includes graphs and other visualizations, natively with PowerShell, or with the Operations Manager HTML-based web console.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor has a powerful analytics engine that allows you to interactively work with log data and combine them with other monitoring data for trending and other data analysis. Views and dashboards allow you to visualize query data in different ways from the Azure portal, and import into Power BI. Monitoring solutions include queries and views to present the data they collect. Insights such as Application Insights, Azure Monitor for VMs, and Azure Monitor for containers include customized visualizations to support interactive monitoring scenarios. 

## Alerting

### Operations Manager

Operations Manager creates alerts in response to pre-defined events, when a performance threshold is met, and when the health state of a monitored component changes. It includes complete management of alerts, allowing you to set their resolution and assign them to different operators or system engineers. You can set notification rules that specify which alerts will send proactive notifications.

Management packs include various predefined alerting rules for different critical conditions in the application being monitored. You can tune these rules or create custom rules to the particular requirements of your environment.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor allows you to create alerts based on a metric crossing a threshold, or based on a scheduled query result. Alerts based on metrics can achieve near real-time results, while scheduled queries have a longer response time, depending on the speed of data ingestion and indexing. Instead of being limited to a specific agent, log query alerts in Azure Monitor allow you to analyze data across all data stored in multiple workspaces. These alerts also include data from a specific Application Insights app by using a cross-workspace query.

While monitoring solutions can include alert rules, typically you create them based on your own requirements.

## Workflows

### Operations Manager

Management packs in Operations Manager contain hundreds of individual workflows, and determine both what data to collect and what action to perform with that data. For example, a rule might sample a performance counter every few minutes, storing its results for analysis. A monitor might sample the same performance counter, and compare its value to a threshold to determine the health state of a monitored object. Another rule might run a script to collect and analyze some data on an agent computer, and fire an alert if it returned a particular value.

Workflows in Operations Manager are independent of each other, so analysis across multiple monitored objects is difficult. These monitoring scenarios must be based on data after it's collected, which is possible but can be difficult, and isn’t common.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor separates data collection from actions and analysis taken from that data. Agents and other data sources write log data to a Log Analytics workspace, and metric data to the metric database, without any analysis of that data or knowledge of how it might be used. Monitor performs alerting and other actions from the stored data, which allows you to perform analysis across data from all sources.

## Extending base platform

### Operations Manager

Operations Manager implements all monitoring logic in a management pack, which you either create yourself or obtain from us or a partner. When you install a management pack, it automatically discovers components of the application or service on different agents, and deploys appropriate rules and monitors. The management pack contains health definitions, alert rules, performance and event collection rules, and views, to provide complete monitoring supporting the infrastructure service or application.

The Operations Manager SDK enables Operations Manager to integrate with third-party monitoring platforms or ITSM software. The SDK is also used by some partner management packs to support monitoring network devices, and deliver custom presentation experiences like the Squared Up HTML5 dashboard or integration with Office Visio.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor collects metrics and logs from Azure resources, with little to no configuration. Monitoring solutions add logic for monitoring an application or service, but still work within the standard log queries and views in Monitor. Insights, such as Application Insights and Azure Monitor for VMs, use the Monitor platform for data collecting and processing, and also provide additional tools to visualize and analyze the data. You can combine data collected by insights with other data, by using core Monitor features such as log queries and alerts.

Monitor supports several methods to collect monitoring or management data from Azure or external resources. You can then extract and forward data from the metric or log stores to your ITSM or monitoring tools, or perform administrative tasks by using the Azure Monitor REST API.
