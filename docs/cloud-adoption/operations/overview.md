# CAF: Operations overview

This section of the CAF the topic of **operations**.

Once your enterprise is engaged in a **digital transformation**, a majority of the work done on the design and implementation teams will revolve around migrating existing workloads from on-premises to Azure, developing and testing new cloud-native applications in Azure, and incorporating new innovative Azure services into existing on-premises workloads. However, these are just the first step in the digital transformation. Once these workloads are up and running in Azure, the next step is to **operate** them in the cloud.

Operating in the cloud refers to the IT processes and non-functional requirements necessary to run workloads in Azure as a business. This includes monitoring of workloads, analyzing dependencies for bottlenecks, developing strategies for disaster recovery, and more.
