# Identity decision guide

In any environment, whether on-premises, hybrid, or cloud-only, IT needs to control which administrators, users, and groups have access to resources. Identity and access management (IAM) services enable you to manage access control in the cloud.

There are several ways to manage identity in a cloud environment, which vary in cost and complexity. A key factor in structuring your cloud-based identity services is the level of integration required with your existing on-premises identity infrastructure.

Cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) identity solutions provide a base level of access control and identity management for cloud resources. However, if your organization's on-premises Active Directory infrastructure has a complex forest structure or customized organizational units (OUs), your cloud-based workloads may require directory replication to the cloud for a consistent set of identities, groups, and roles between your on-premises and cloud environments. If directory replication is required for a global solution, complexity can increase significantly. Additionally, support for applications dependent on legacy authentication mechanisms may require the deployment of domain services in the cloud.

## Determine identity integration requirements

| Question | Cloud baseline | Directory synchronization | Cloud-hosted domain services | Active Directory Federation Services |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Do you currently lack an on-premises directory service? | Yes | No | No | No |
| Do your workloads need to authenticate against on-premises identity services? | No | Yes | No | No |
| Do your workloads depend on legacy authentication mechanisms, such as Kerberos or NTLM? | No | No | Yes | No |
| Is integration between cloud and on-premises identity services impossible? | No | No | Yes | No |
| Do you require single sign-on across multiple identity providers? | No | No | No | Yes |

As part of planning your migration to Azure, you will need to determine how best to integrate your existing identity management and cloud identity services. The following are common integration scenarios.

### Cloud baseline

Public cloud platforms provide a native IAM system for granting users and groups access to management features. If your organization lacks a significant on-premises identity solution, and you plan on migrating workloads to be compatible with cloud-based authentication mechanisms, you should build your identity infrastructure using a cloud-native identity service.

**Cloud baseline assumptions**. Using a purely cloud-native identity infrastructure assumes the following:

- Your cloud-based resources will not have dependencies on on-premises directory services or Active Directory servers, or workloads can be modified to remove those dependencies your.
- The application or service workloads being migrated either support authentication mechanisms compatible with cloud identity providers or can be modified easily to support them. Cloud native identity providers rely on internet-ready authentication mechanisms such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. Existing workloads that depend on legacy authentication methods using protocols such as Kerberos or NTLM may need to be refactored before migrating to the cloud.

> [!TIP]
> Most cloud-native identity services are not full replacements for traditional on-premises directories. Directory features such as computer management or group policy may not be available without using additional tools or services.

Completely migrating your identity services to a cloud-based provider eliminates the need to maintain your own identity infrastructure, significantly simplifying your IT management.

### Directory synchronization

For organizations with an existing identity infrastructure, directory synchronization is often the best solution for preserving existing user and access management while providing the required IAM capabilities for managing cloud resources. This process continuously replicates directory information between the cloud and on-premises environments, allowing single sign-on (SSO) for users and a consistent identity, role, and permission system across your entire organization.

Note: Organizations that have adopted Office 365 may have already implemented [directory synchronization](/office365/enterprise/set-up-directory-synchronization) between their on-premises Active Directory infrastructure and Azure Active Directory.

**Directory synchronization assumptions**. Using a synchronized identity solution assumes the following:

- You need to maintain a common set of user accounts and groups across your cloud and on-premises IT infrastructure.
- Your on-premises identity services support replication with your cloud identity provider.
- You require SSO mechanisms for users accessing cloud and on-premises identity providers.

> [!TIP]
> Any cloud-based workloads that depend on legacy authentication mechanisms that are not supported by cloud-based identity services like Azure AD will still require either connectivity to on-premises domain services or virtual servers in the cloud environment providing these services. Using on-premises identity services also introduces dependencies on connectivity between the cloud and on-premises networks.

### Cloud-hosted domain services

If you have workloads that depend on claims-based authentication using legacy protocols such as Kerberos or NTLM, and those workloads cannot be refactored to accept modern authentication protocols such as SAML or OAuth and OpenID Connect, you may need to migrate some of your domain services to the cloud as part of your cloud deployment.

This type of deployment involves deploying virtual machines running Active Directory in your cloud-based virtual networks to provide domain services for resources in the cloud. Any existing applications and services migrating to your cloud network should be able to use of these cloud-hosted directory servers with minor modifications.

It's likely that your existing directories and domain services will continue to be used in your on-premises environment. In this scenario, it's recommended that you also use directory synchronization to provide a common set of users and roles in both the cloud and on-premises environments.

**Cloud hosted domain services assumptions**. Performing a directory migration assumes the following:

- Your workloads depend on claims-based authentication using protocols like Kerberos or NTLM.
- Your workload virtual machines need to be domain-joined for management or application of Active Directory group policy purposes.

> [!TIP]
> While a directory migration coupled with cloud-hosted domain services provides great flexibility when migrating existing workloads, hosting virtual machines within your cloud virtual network to provide these services does increase the complexity of your IT management tasks. As your cloud migration experience matures, examine the long-term maintenance requirements of hosting these servers. Consider whether refactoring existing workloads for compatibility with cloud identity providers such as Azure Active Directory can reduce the need for these cloud-hosted servers.

### Active Directory Federation Services

Identity federation establishes trust relationships across multiple identity management systems to allow common authentication and authorization capabilities. You can then support single sign-on capabilities across multiple domains within your organization or identity systems managed by your customers or business partners.

Azure AD supports federation of on-premises Active Directory domains using [Active Directory Federation Services](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-whatis) (AD FS). See the reference architecture [Extend AD FS to Azure](../../../reference-architectures/identity/adfs.md) to see how this can be implemented in Azure.

## Evolving identity integration

Identity integration is an iterative process. You may want to start with a cloud native solution with a small set of users and corresponding roles for an initial deployment. As your migration matures, consider adopting a federated model or performing a full directory migration of your on-premises identity services to the cloud. Revisit your identity strategy in every iteration of your migration process.

## Learn more

See the following for more information about identity services on the Azure platform.

- [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory). Azure AD provides cloud-based identity services. It allows you to manage access to your Azure resources and control identity management, device registration, user provisioning, application access control, and data protection.
- [Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity). The Azure AD Connect tool allows you to connect Azure AD instances with your existing identity management solutions, allowing synchronization of your existing directory in the cloud.
- [Role-based access control](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (RBAC). Azure AD provides RBAC to efficiently and securely manage access to resources in the management plane. Jobs and responsibilities are organized into roles, and users are assigned to these roles. RBAC allows you to control who has access to a resource along with which actions a user can perform on that resource.
- [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) (PIM). PIM lowers the exposure time of resource access privileges and increases your visibility into their use through reports and alerts. It limits users to taking on their privileges "just in time" (JIT), or by assigning privileges for a shorter duration, after which privileges are revoked automatically.
- [Integrate on-premises Active Directory domains with Azure Active Directory](../../../reference-architectures/identity/azure-ad.md). This reference architecture provides an example of directory synchronization between on-premises Active Directory domains and Azure AD.
- [Extend Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to Azure.](../../../reference-architectures/identity/adds-extend-domain.md) This reference architecture provides an example of deploying AD DS servers to extend domain services to cloud-based resources.
- [Extend Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to Azure](../../../reference-architectures/identity/adfs.md). This reference architecture configures Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to perform federated authentication and authorization with your Azure AD directory.
