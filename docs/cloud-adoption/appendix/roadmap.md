# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure and use technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all aspects of technology, from infrastructure to software. The cloud allows enterprises to provision and to consume resources only as needed. However, cloud adoption is a means to an end. Businesses adopt the cloud when they realize it can address any of these business opportunities:

- Businesses are motivated to **migrate** to the cloud to:
  - Optimize operations.
  - Simplify technology.
  - Increase business agility.
  - Reduce costs.
  - Prepare for new technical capabilities.
  - Scaling to market demands or geos.
- Businesses are motivated to **innovate** using the cloud to:
  - Improve customer experiences.
  - Increase customer engagements.
  - Transform products.
  - Prepare for and build new technical capabilities.
  - Scale to market demands or geos.

## Vision and objectives

Removing key obstacles and enabling change requires more than implementation guidance. The Cloud Adoption Framework is a set of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices, and tools that help align strategies for business, culture, and technology to enable the desired business outcomes. Its modular structure guides the customer through their cloud journey. The Cloud Adoption Framework can stand by itself and provide self-service structured guidance for customers. The Cloud Adoption Framework builds on existing guidance whenever possible to meet the following objectives:

- **Technical strategy objective:** Establish scalable technical strategies, beyond a minimum viable product, so customers can easily customize and adapt to meet their needs and address common constraints.
- **Business strategy objective:** Without defining business strategy in this guidance, we will help architects understand, document, and communicate the business strategy so the right decisions can be made.
- **Culture strategy objective:** While not providing deep guidance on facilitating culture or organizational change, we will provide methodologies, scenarios, and questions that will help identify and remove cultural roadblocks to the technical strategy.

## Fulfilling the vision

The Cloud Adoption Framework is an overarching framework that covers Plan, Ready, and Adopt phases across the Migration and Innovation motivations for cloud adoption, supported by Governance and Operations guidance.

Microsoft is actively building this aspirational framework in collaboration with customers, partners, and internal teams. To encourage partnership, content will be released in public preview as it becomes available. These public preview releases enable testing, validating, and incrementally refining the guidance. The framework will reach general availability (GA) when the aspirational goals are met.

To successfully adopting the cloud, a customer must prepare its people, technologies, and processes for this digital transformation. The Cloud Adoption Framework includes a section outlining the overall adoption journeys, both Migration and Innovation, as an overview for the customers. This section is composed of the following adoption journey phases:

- **Plan:** Align business outcomes to actionable technology backlogs. This phase consists of three areas of early stage planning activities:
  - Define the business justification and business outcomes.
  - Prioritize workloads based on impacts to the business outcomes.
  - Create a cloud adoption plan based on the current digital estate and prioritized workloads.
- **Ready:** Prepare the people, culture, and environment for change. This phase has three key components:
  - Create a cloud strategy team and other organizational alignment.
  - Create a skills readiness plan across roles and functions.
  - Establish an Azure foundation by preparing the cloud environment.
- **Adopt:** Implement the desired changes across IT and business processes to help customers realize their business, technology, and people strategies. This phase includes several areas that will vary depending on what the organization is implementing:
  - Migration of workloads and assets.
  - Apps and data modernization.
  - Cloud governance.
  - Management and operation of assets and workloads in the cloud.

These phases are not linear and will likely become a cycle, with customers revisiting and expanding adoption plans as their people become more cloud proficient and their apps and workloads are properly managed and operated, aligned with corporate policies, and deliver on their business outcomes.

## Quarterly roadmap

The following outlines specific releases per quarter, to demonstrate maturity of each section of content on a quarterly basis.

### Q2 2019

- **First release:** The Migrate, Ready, and Plan sections will each launch as First Releases this quarter, with one section anticipated to release each month.
- **Early testing release:** The Govern, Migrate, and Ready sections are expected to complete early testing releases this quarter.
- **Ongoing maturity release:** The Govern and Migrate sections are expected to each have at least one release, focusing on deeper definition of actionable next steps. The Govern section is expected to see additional investments in best practices and expanded scope.
- **Out-of-band release:** The Ready section will have an out-of-band release during late April and May. The content in the Ready section will be pulled directly from the Azure readiness playbook to support forthcoming integration with the Azure portal. This content will be improved and aligned to Cloud Adoption Framework methodologies before the official first release of the Ready section in late May.

### Q3 2019

- **First release:** App Innovation and Data Innovation.
- **Early testing release:** Plan and App Innovation.
- **Ongoing maturity release:** The Ready, Plan, Migrate, and Govern sections will each see investment in automation, best practices, and expanded scope in this quarter.

## Looking back (recent releases)

**Cloud Adoption Framework created (October 1, 2018):** Customers want us to help drive a structured approach to business transformation using the cloud.

In early 2018, Microsoft released the Cloud Operating Model (COM). COM was a guide that helped customers understand the _what_ and the _why_ of digital transformation. This helped to make customers aware of all the areas to be addressed: business strategy, culture strategy, and technology strategy. What was not included in the COM were the specific _how-to's_. Customers were left with the question, "Where do we go from here?" Due to this gap, many of our field teams began building their own models and engagement. While directionally accurate, each team was communicating slightly different information, which ultimately led to more customer confusion.

In October 2018, we began to review all the models that had proliferated across our organization, we found roughly 60 different cloud adoption models. At this time, a cross-Microsoft team was established to bring everything together. This effort culminated in the creation of a single model, Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, with the intention of helping customers understand the _what_ and _why_ and provide unified guidance on the _how_ from Microsoft to help them accelerate their cloud journey.

**Q1 2019 release (February 11, 2019):** Based on customer feedback, we began building the Govern pillar. Customers indicated this component is necessary to accelerate their migration efforts and further their adoption of cloud services. The trust and protection that comes from establishing a strong governance model builds the confidence that businesses need to pursue their cloud adoption goals.

This first release helped test the Cloud Adoption Framework's unification of an important Microsoft message across customer, partner, and services conversations. Keeping that unified message practical, we focused on delivering an actionable four-step process:

1. Define a customer end state based on a common methodology.
2. Provide an assessment to define gaps and areas of governance investment.
3. Define a minimum viable product (MVP) to help the customer iterate rapidly.
4. Provide a way to incrementally improve the MVP to mitigate risks and meet business requirements.

**Q2 2019 release (April 15, 2019):** Cloud migration tools can easily migrate tens of thousands of IT assets to the cloud. However, customer feedback indicates that cloud migrations are blocked by culture and technical readiness. The spring release addresses these blockers by defining an iterative approach to cloud migration. The core methodology includes a streamlined Azure migration guide for learning the tools and basic processes, with expanded scope and best practices sections for building on this baseline guidance.

This release also includes expansions to the Plan section of the Cloud Adoption Framework that focus on business planning. It also incorporates the existing Azure readiness guide within the new Ready section of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

_Table of Contents (Left Navigation) changes:_ The left navigation pane has been streamlined to follow the Plan, Ready, and Adopt approach. The Getting Started section has been realigned to provide the reader with an executive summary of the three journeys supported in the vision for the Cloud Adoption Framework.
