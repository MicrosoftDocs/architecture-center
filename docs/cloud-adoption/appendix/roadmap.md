# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The cloud presents a fundamental shift in the way enterprises procure and use technology resources, from full ownership and responsibility of all levels of technology to provisioning and consuming resources as needed. However, adoption of the cloud is a means, it is not the end goal. Businesses are motivated to adopt the cloud when they realize it can address any of these business events:

* Optimizing operations, simplifying technology, increasing business agility, reducing costs, preparing for new technical capabilities, and scaling to market demands or geos, businesses would be motivated to **migrate** to the cloud
* Improving customer experiences, increasing customer engagements, transforming products, preparing and building new technical capabilities, and scaling to market demands or geos, businesses would be motivated to **innovate** leveraging the cloud

## Vision and Objectives

Removing key blockers and enabling change, requires more than implementation guidance. The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a set of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices and tools that aids in aligning strategies for business, culture, and technology to enable the desired business outcomes. It is structured in a modular way to simultaneously, follow and guide the customer in their cloud journey. CAF should be able to stand by itself and provide the structured guidance for customers in a self-service approach. CAF builds on existing guidance, where possible, to achieve the following objectives:

* **Technical strategy objective:** establish scalable technical strategies, beyond the “minimally viable product”, enabling organizations to easily customize and adopt to meet their needs and address common constraints.
* **Business strategy objective:** without defining business strategy in this guidance, we will help architects document, communicate, and understand the business strategy so the right decisions can be made.
* **Culture strategy objective:** without creating deep guidance to facilitate culture or HR change, we will provide methodologies, scenarios, and questions which will trigger changes required to remove culture as a roadblock to the technical strategy.  

## Fulfilling the vision

CAF is an overarching framework which covers Plan, Ready and Adopt across the Migration and Innovation motivations for cloud adoption, supported by Governance and Operations guidance.  

Microsoft is actively building out this aspirational framework with customers, partners, and others in the market. To encourage partnership, content will be released in public preview as it becomes available. These public preview releases serve as a means of testing, validating, and incrementally refining the guidance. The framework will reach general availability (GA), when the aspirational objectives above have been realized.

To be successful in adopting the cloud, organizations must prepare its people, technology and processes to be ready for this digital transformation. CAF includes a section outlining the overall adoption journeys, Migration and Innovation, as an overview for the customers, and it’s broken down into the adoption journey phases:

* **Plan:** Align business outcomes to actionable technology backlogs. Planning consists of three areas of early stage planning activities: 1) Defining business justification and business outcomes, 2) Prioritizing workloads based on impacts to the business outcomes, 3) Creating a cloud adoption plan based on current digital estate and prioritized workloads.
* **Ready:** Prepare the people, culture and environment for change. There are 3 key components in Ready: 1) Create a Cloud Strategy Team and other organizational alignment, 2) Create a skills readiness plan across roles and functions, 3) Set up an Azure Foundation by preparing the cloud environment.
* **Adopt:** Implement the desired changes across IT and business process helping customers realize their business, technology and people strategies. Adopt includes several areas of work that will depend on what the organization is actually implementing. This includes 4 main areas: 1) workloads and assets migration, 2) apps and data modernization, 3) cloud governance, 4) assets and workloads management and operation in the cloud.  

In reality, these phases are not linear and most likely would turn into a cycle, where customers are revisiting and expanding adoption plans, as their people becomes more cloud proficient, their apps and workloads are properly managed and operated, aligned with corporate policies, delivering on their business outcomes.

## Content maturation

Each new section of CAF will adhere to a similar maturation cycle, as follows:

### First Release (AKA Content MVP)

Create an opportunity to partner with customers, Microsoft partners, and the many roles across Microsoft through a well defined public preview of the methodology and models within that section of guidance. The goal of a first release is to demonstrate a growth mindset by quickly getting to a defined testing point.

Definition of Done: Each First Release should contain:

* Functional theory/considerations based on the lessons learned alongside existing customers
* An actionable baseline (or MVP) which demonstrates basic usage of the tools required
* A small number of best practices and expanded scope scenarios

### Early Testing (Feedback integration)

Quick iterations to integrate what we learn when testing/validating the guidance alongside customers, partners, and Microsoft employees executing in the field. Quickly fix any technical inaccuracies or confusing messaging.

Definition of Done: Each Early Testing Release should contain:

* Refined theory/considerations
* Tested and customer verified baseline
* Integrate feedback from 1st release, customer, and partner testing

### On-going Maturity

Continuous improvement and expansion of the content to meet emerging customer needs. New releases occur in a monthly cycle across the Cloud Adoption Framework. However, not every section of CAF with be updated in every months release.

Definition of Done: Each subsequent release should contain:

* Invest in additional Best Practices
* Invest in additional Expanded Scope
* Invest in deeper, more actionable next steps
* Invest in automation and templates for proven, repeatable guidance
* Ensure theory, considerations, and actionable baselines stay aligned to new investments

### Out of band releases

One of the goals of CAF is to consolidate various points of guidance across Microsoft. On occasion, new content may be consumed by CAF outside of the maturation cycles above, to meet time sensitive guidance needs. These releases are considered "out of band", as the content will be consumed and re-published for a brief period of time prior to the official First Release of a given section. This is rare, but will occasionally show up on the roadmap.

## Quarterly Roadmap

The following outlines specific releases per quarter, to demonstrate maturity of each section of content on a quarterly basis.

### Second quarter 2019 (FY19Q4)

* First release: Migrate, Ready, and Plan will each launch as First Releases this quarter, with one section anticipated to release each month.
* Early Testing release: Govern, Migrate and Ready are expected to complete Early Testing releases this quarter.
* On-going Maturity release: Govern and Migrate are expected to have at least one release each, with a focus on going deeper into actionable next steps. Govern is expected to see additional investments in Best Practices and Expanded Scope.
* Out of band release: Ready will have an Out of Band release during late April and throughout May. The content in the Ready section will be pulled directly from the Azure Readiness Playbook to support a coming integration with the Azure Portal. This content will be improved and aligned to CAF methodologies prior to the official First Release of the Ready section in late May.

### Third quarter 2019 (FY20Q1)

* First release: App Innovation and Data Innovation
* Early Testing release: Plan and App Innovation
* On-going Maturity release: Ready, Plan, Migrate, and Govern will each see investment in automation, best practices, and expanded scope in this quarter

## Looking back (Recent releases)

**Cloud Adoption Framework created (10/1/2018):** What we have heard from customers is that they want us to help drive a structured approach to transform their business leveraging the cloud.

In early 2018, Microsoft released the Cloud Operating Model (COM). COM was a guide which helped customers understand the WHAT and the WHY of digital transformation. This helped customer get a sense of all the areas which needed to be addressed, business strategy, culture strategy and technology strategy. What was not included in the COM was the specific HOW TO’s, this left customer’s asking the question, “Where to from here”. With this gap many of our field teams began building their own models and engagement. Whilst directionally accurate, each team was saying something slightly different which ultimately led to broader customer confusion.  

In October 2018, we began to take stock of all the models which had proliferated across our org, we found roughly 60 different cloud adoption models. At this time, a cross-Microsoft team was established to bring everything together. This culminated in the creation of a single model, Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF), with the intention of helping customers understand the WHAT, WHY and provide unified guidance on the HOW from Microsoft to help them accelerate their cloud journey.  

**Winter Release (2/11/2019):** Based on customer feedback, we started building out the Govern pillar. Customers indicated that this was a blocker to accelerating their migration efforts and further adoption of cloud services. The trust and protection that comes from having a strong governance model in place builds the confidence businesses need to confidently pursue cloud adoption goals.

This first release served as a test of CAF's ability to unify an important Microsoft message across customer, partner, and services conversations. Ensuring that we keep that unified message practical, we focused on delivering an actionable 4 step process as follows:

1) Establish a customer end state based on a common methodology
2) Provide an assessment to define gaps and areas of governance investment
3) Define a minimal viable products (MVPs) to help the customer iterate rapidly
4) Provide a means of evolving the MVP to mitigate risks and meet business requirements

**Spring Release (4/15/2019):** Cloud migration tooling can easily migrate tens of thousands of IT assets to the cloud. However, customer feedback suggested that cloud migrations are blocked by culture and technical readiness. The spring release addresses these blockers by defining an iterative approach to cloud migration. Within the core methodology is a streamlined azure migration guide for learning the tools and basic processes, with expanded scope and best practices sections for building on this baseline guidance.

This release also includes expansions to the Plan section of CAF which focuses on business planning. It also incorporates the existing Azure Readiness Guide within the new Ready section of CAF.

*Table of Contents (Left Navigation) changes:* The left navigation has been streamlined to follow the Plan, Ready, Adopt approach. The Getting Started section has been realigned to start the reader with an executive summary of the three journeys supported in the vision for CAF.
