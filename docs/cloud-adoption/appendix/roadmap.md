# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure and use technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all aspects of technology from infrastructure to software. The cloud allows enterprises provisioning and consuming resources only when needed. However, cloud adoption is a means to an end. Businesses adopt the cloud when they realize it can address any of these business opportunities:

- Optimizing operations, simplifying technology, increasing business agility, reducing costs, preparing for new technical capabilities, and scaling to market demands or geos, businesses are motivated to **migrate** to the cloud.
- Improving customer experiences, increasing customer engagements, transforming products, preparing and building new technical capabilities, and scaling to market demands or geos, businesses are motivated to **innovate** using the cloud.

## Vision and objectives

Removing key obstacles and enabling change requires more than implementation guidance. The Cloud Adoption Framework is a set of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices, and tools that help align strategies for business, culture, and technology to enable the desired business outcomes. Its modular structure follows and guides the customer through their cloud journey. The Cloud Adoption Framework can stand by itself and provide self-service structured guidance for customers. The Cloud Adoption Framework builds on existing guidance whenever possible to meet the following objectives:

- **Technical strategy objective:** Establish scalable technical strategies, beyond a minimum viable product, so customers can easily customize and adapt to meet their needs and address common constraints.
- **Business strategy objective:** Without defining business strategy in this guidance, we will help architects understand, document, and communicate the business strategy so the right decisions can be made.
- **Culture strategy objective:** While not providing deep guidance on facilitating culture or HR change, we will provide methodologies, scenarios, and questions that will identify and help remove cultural roadblocks to the technical strategy.

## Fulfilling the vision

The Cloud Adoption Framework is an overarching framework that covers Plan, Ready and Adopt phases across the Migration and Innovation motivations for cloud adoption, supported by Governance and Operations guidance.  

Microsoft is actively building this aspirational framework in collaboration with customers, partners, and internal teams. To encourage partnership, content will be released in public preview as it becomes available. These public preview releases enable testing, validating, and incrementally refining the guidance. The framework will reach general availability (GA) when the aspirational goals are met.

To successfully adopting the cloud, a customer must prepare its people, technologies, and processes for this digital transformation. The Cloud Adoption Framework includes a section outlining the overall adoption journeys, Migration and Innovation, as an overview for the customers. This section is comprised of the following adoption journey phases:

- **Plan:** Align business outcomes to actionable technology backlogs. This phase consists of three areas of early stage planning activities:
  - Define the business justification and business outcomes.
  - Prioritize workloads based on impacts to the business outcomes.
  - Create a cloud adoption plan based on the current digital estate and prioritized workloads.
- **Ready:** Prepare the people, culture and environment for change. There are three key components in this phase:
  - Create a Cloud Strategy team and other organizational alignment.
  - Create a skills readiness plan across roles and functions.
  - Establish an Azure foundation by preparing the cloud environment.
- **Adopt:** Implement the desired changes across IT and business processes to help customers realize their business, technology, and people strategies. This phase includes several areas that will vary depending on what the organization is actually implementing:
  - Workloads and assets migration.
  - Apps and data modernization.
  - Cloud governance.
  - Assets and workloads management and operation in the cloud.

These phases are not linear and most likely will turn into a cycle, where customers are revisiting and expanding adoption plans, as their people become more cloud proficient, their apps and workloads are properly managed and operated, aligned with corporate policies, delivering on their business outcomes.

## Quarterly roadmap

The following outlines specific releases per quarter, to demonstrate maturity of each section of content on a quarterly basis.

### Q2 2019

- **First release:** Migrate, Ready, and Plan will each launch as First Releases this quarter, with one section anticipated to release each month.
- **Early testing release:** Govern, Migrate and Ready are expected to complete early testing releases this quarter.
- **Ongoing maturity release:** Govern and Migrate are expected to have at least one release each, with a focus on going deeper into actionable next steps. Govern is expected to see additional investments in Best Practices and Expanded Scope.
- **Out-of-band release:** Ready will have an out-of-band release during late April and throughout May. The content in the Ready section will be pulled directly from the Azure Readiness Playbook to support a coming integration with the Azure Portal. This content will be improved and aligned to Cloud Adoption Framework methodologies prior to the official first release of the Ready section in late May.

### Q3 2019

- **First release:** App Innovation and Data Innovation.
- **Early testing release:** Plan and App Innovation.
- **Ongoing maturity release:** Ready, Plan, Migrate, and Govern will each see investment in automation, best practices, and expanded scope in this quarter.

## Looking back (recent releases)

**Cloud Adoption Framework created (10/1/2018):** Customers want us to help drive a structured approach to business transformation using the cloud.

In early 2018, Microsoft released the Cloud Operating Model (COM). COM was a guide that helped customers understand the WHAT and the WHY of digital transformation. This helped customer get a sense of all the areas that needed to be addressed, business strategy, culture strategy and technology strategy. What was not included in the COM was the specific HOW TO’s, this left customers asking the question, "Where do we go from here?" With this gap many of our field teams began building their own models and engagement. Whilst directionally accurate, each team was saying something slightly different, which ultimately led to broader customer confusion.

In October 2018, we began to take stock of all the models that had proliferated across our organization, we found roughly 60 different cloud adoption models. At this time, a cross-Microsoft team was established to bring everything together. This culminated in the creation of a single model, Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, with the intention of helping customers understand the **what** and **why** and provide unified guidance on the **how** from Microsoft to help them accelerate their cloud journey.

**Winter Release (2/11/2019):** Based on customer feedback, we started building out the Govern pillar. Customers indicated that this was a blocker to accelerating their migration efforts and further adoption of cloud services. The trust and protection that comes from having a strong governance model in place builds the confidence businesses need to confidently pursue cloud adoption goals.

This first release served as a test of the Cloud Adoption Framework's ability to unify an important Microsoft message across customer, partner, and services conversations. Ensuring that we keep that unified message practical, we focused on delivering an actionable 4 step process as follows:

1. Establish a customer end state based on a common methodology.
2. Provide an assessment to define gaps and areas of governance investment.
3. Define a minimum viable product (MVPs) to help the customer iterate rapidly.
4. Provide a means of evolving the MVP to mitigate risks and meet business requirements.

**Spring Release (4/15/2019):** Cloud migration tooling can easily migrate tens of thousands of IT assets to the cloud. However, customer feedback suggested that cloud migrations are blocked by culture and technical readiness. The spring release addresses these blockers by defining an iterative approach to cloud migration. Within the core methodology is a streamlined Azure migration guide for learning the tools and basic processes, with expanded scope and best practices sections for building on this baseline guidance.

This release also includes expansions to the Plan section of the Cloud Adoption Framework that focus on business planning. It also incorporates the existing Azure Readiness Guide within the new Ready section of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

*Table of Contents (Left Navigation) changes:* The left navigation has been streamlined to follow the Plan, Ready, Adopt approach. The Getting Started section has been realigned to start the reader with an executive summary of the three journeys supported in the vision for the Cloud Adoption Framework.
