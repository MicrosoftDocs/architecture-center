# Cloud Operating Model is now part of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

In early 2018, Microsoft released the Cloud Operating Model (COM). The COM was a guide that helped customers understand the **what** and the **why** of digital transformation. This helped customers get a sense of all the areas that needed to be addressed: business strategy, culture strategy, and technology strategy. What was not included in the COM were the specific **how-to's**, which left customers wondering, "Where do we go from here?"

In October 2018, we began a review of all the models that had proliferated across the Microsoft community, we found roughly 60 different cloud adoption models. A cross-Microsoft team was established to bring everything together as a dedicated engineering "product" with defined implementations across services, sales, and marketing. This effort culminated in the creation of a single model, the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, designed to help customers understand the **what** and **why** and provide unified guidance on the **how** to help them accelerate their cloud journey. The goal of this project is to create a One Microsoft approach to cloud adoption.

## Using Cloud Operating Model practices within the Cloud Adoption Framework

For a similar approach to COM, readers should begin with one of the following:

- [Getting started with cloud migration](../getting-started/migrate.md)
- [Getting started with cloud-enabled innovation](../getting-started/innovate.md)
- [Enabling adoption success](../getting-started/enable.md)

The guidance previously provided in COM is still relevant to the Cloud Adoption Framework. The experience is different, but the structure of the Cloud Adoption Framework is simply an expansion of that guidance. To transition from COM to the Cloud Adoption Framework, an understanding of scope and structure is important. The following two sections describe that transition.

## Scope

COM established a scope comprised of the following components:

![Scope of the Cloud Adoption Framework](../_images/caf-scope.png)

- **Business strategy:** Establish clear business objectives and outcomes that are to be supported by cloud adoption.
- **Technology strategy:** Align the overarching strategy to guide adoption of the cloud in alignment with the business strategy.
- **People strategy:** Develop a strategy for training the people and evolving the culture to enable business success.

The high-level scopes of the Cloud Operating Model and the Cloud Adoption Framework are similar. Business, culture, and technology are reflected throughout the guidance and each methodology within the Cloud Adoption Framework.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two significant points of clarity with the Cloud Adoption Framework's scope. In the Cloud Adoption Framework, business strategy goes beyond the documentation of cloud costs; it is about understanding motivations, desired outcomes, returns, and cloud costs to create actionable plans and clear business justifications. In the Cloud Adoption Framework, people strategy goes beyond training to include approaches that create demonstrable cultural maturity. A few areas on the roadmap include demonstrations of the impact of Agile management, DevOps integration, customer empathy and obsession, and lean product development approaches.

## Structure

COM included an infographic that outlined the various decisions and actions needed during a cloud adoption effort. That graphic provided a clear means of communicating next steps and dependent decisions.

The Cloud Adoption Framework follows a similar model. However, as the actions and decisions expanded into multiple decision trees, complexity quickly made a single graphical view appear overwhelming. To simplify the guidance and make it more immediately actionable, the single graphic has been decomposed into the following structures.

At the executive level, the Cloud Adoption Framework has been simplified into the following three phases of adoption and two primary journeys.

![Executive level structure of the Cloud Adoption Framework](../_images/caf-structure.png)

The three phases of adoption are:

- **Plan:** Develop the business plan to guide cloud adoption in alignment with desired business outcomes.
- **Ready:** Prepare the people, organization, and technical environment for execution of the adoption plan.
- **Adopt:** Technical strategy required to execute a specific adoption plan, in alignment with a specific adoption journey, to realize business outcomes.

The three phases of cloud adoption have been mapped to two specific journeys:

- [Migrate](../getting-started/migrate.md): Move existing workloads to the cloud.
- [Innovate](../getting-started/innovate.md): Modernize existing workloads and create new products and services.

Additional resources required to be successful in a cloud adoption journey can be found in [Enabling adoption success](../getting-started/enable.md).

## Next steps

To resume your journey where COM left off, choose one of the following cloud adoption journeys:

- [Getting started with cloud migration](../getting-started/migrate.md)
- [Getting started with cloud-enabled innovation](../getting-started/innovate.md)
- [Enabling adoption success](../getting-started/enable.md)
