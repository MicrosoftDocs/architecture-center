# CAF: How can the cloud advance my business strategy?

It depends... The cloud delivers a number of fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing a number of business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve basic business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

The cloud is a very fluid concept that can fill countless needs in many different ways. This expansive capability offers great potential, but also makes it very difficult to answer the question above. To take advance of the cloud's potential, it is important to start with by documenting the business strategy in a way that is understandable to cloud technicians and also palatable to business stakeholders.

## Business outcome framework

In the business strategy section of the Cloud Adoption Framework, we provide tools to capture targeted business value in a cross-functional model, that we call the business outcome framework. Those targeted business outcomes can then be mapped to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach the desired state of transformation.

- Review [sample business outcomes](business-outcomes/index.md). Identify any business outcomes that directly align with the targeted business strategy. Document those in the provided [business outcome Microsoft Excel template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/business-outcome-template.xlsx) to share with internal partners during the Transformation Journey.
- Identify the [learning metrics](learning-metrics.md) that would best represent progress towards the identified business outcomes. It may be necessary to engage the CIO, or members of the IT team, to select relevant metrics based on the current environment.
- Establish a [financial model](financial-models.md) that aligns with the outcomes and learning metrics.
- Document the [digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md) in the current environment to populate the financial model. This will establish investment criteria, time to break even, and return on investment (ROI)

## Next steps

Document and communicate desired [business outcomes](business-outcomes/overview.md) using the business outcomes framework.
