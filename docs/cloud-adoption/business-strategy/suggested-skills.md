# Skills readiness path during the "Plan" phase of a migration journey

During the "Plan" phase of a migration journey, the objective is to develop the plans necessary to guide migration implementation. This phase requires a few critical skills including: establishing the vision, building the business justification, rationalizing the digital estate, and creating a migration backlog (technical plan). The following are a list of learning paths to develop each of these skills:

## Establishing the vision

Success of any cloud adoption effort is defined by the business vision. When the technical team doesn't understand the motives and desired outcomes, it can be difficult to guide the technical efforts towards a business success. The following articles help document and articulate the business vision to the technical team to drive better decisions.

- [Adoption motivations](./motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md): Document and articulate the reasons behind this technical effort.
- [Business outcomes](./business-outcomes/index.md): Clearly articulate what is expected of the technical team in terms of business changes.
- [Learning metrics](./learning-metrics.md): Establish short-term metrics that can show progress towards longer-term business outcomes.

## Build the business justification

Justifying the investment to adopt the cloud can require deeper analysis and an understanding of the organization's accounting practices. The articles on business justification can help develop these skills.

- [Cloud migration business case](./cloud-migration-business-case.md): Establish a business case for cloud migration

## Rationalize the digital estate

Aligning the desired business case with current-state and future-state digital estate inventory can be used to refine the business case. The following articles can guide the development of a digital estate rationalization.

- [Incremental rationalization](../digital-estate/rationalize.md): An agile approach to rationalization that properly aligns late-bound technical decisions.
- [Rs of rationalization](../digital-estate/5-rs-of-rationalization.md): Understand the various rationalization options.

## Create a migration backlog (technical plan)

Converting the business case and rationalized digital estate into an actionable migration plan can guide the technical activities required to achieve the desired business outcomes.

## Business planning skills

During the Ready phase, technical staff will be called upon to create a migration landing zone capable of hosting, operating, and governing workloads that have been migrated to the cloud. Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths:

- [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account): The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services you provision and handles your personal settings like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal): Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Introduction to Azure](/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure): Get started with Azure by creating and configuring your first virtual machine in the cloud.
- [Introduction to security in Azure](/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure): Discuss the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.
- [Manage resources in Azure](/learn/paths/manage-resources-in-azure): Learn how to work with the Azure command line and web portal to create, manage, and control cloud-based resources.
- [Create a VM](/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure): Create a virtual machine using the Azure portal.
- [Azure Networking](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-networking): Learn some of the Azure networking basics and how Azure networking helps improve resiliency and reduce latency.
- [Azure Compute Options](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute): Review the Azure compute services.
- [Secure resources with RBAC](/learn/modules/secure-azure-resources-with-rbac): Use RBAC to secure resources.
- [Data Storage options](/learn/modules/intro-to-data-in-azure/index): Benefits of Azure data storage.

## Organizational skills

Depending on the motivations and business outcomes associated with a cloud adoption effort, leaders may be required to establish new organizational structures or virtual teams (V-teams) to facilitate various functions. The following articles will help develop the skills necessary to structure those teams in accordance with desired outcomes.

- [Initial organization alignment](../organization/index.md): Overview of organizational alignment and various team structures to facilitate specific goals.
- [Breaking down silos and fiefdoms](../organization/fiefdoms-silos.md): Understanding two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide the team to productive collaboration.

## Deeper skills exploration

Beyond these initial options for developing skills, a variety of learning options are available.

### Typical mappings of cloud IT roles include

Microsoft and partners offer a variety of options for all audiences to develop their skills with Microsoft Azure services.

- [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/product-training/microsoft-azure): Offers training from the people who helped build Microsoft Azure. From a basic overview to deep technical training, IT staff will learn how to use Microsoft Azure for their business.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Cloud Essentials](https://www.microsoft.com/azureessentials): Provides a free annual subscription that includes cloud services, education, and support benefits. IT Pro Cloud Essentials provides IT implementers with hands-on experience, targeted educational opportunities, and access to experts in areas that matter most to increase knowledge and create a path to career advancement.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Career Center](https://www.microsoft.com/itpro): Serves as a free online resource to help map your cloud career path. Learn what industry experts suggest for your cloud role and the skills to get you there. Follow a learning curriculum at your own pace to build the skills you need most to stay relevant.

We recommend turning knowledge of Microsoft Azure into official recognition with [Microsoft Azure certification training and exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-certification.aspx).

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn is a new approach to learning. Readiness for the new responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily. Microsoft Learn provides a more rewarding approach to hands-on learning that helps you achieve your goals faster. Earn points, levels, and achieve more!

The following are a few examples of role-specific learning paths on Microsoft Learn:

[Business users](/learn/browse/?roles=business-user) may experience a steep learning curve when asked to participate in planning, testing, and adoption of cloud-based technology. Microsoft Learn helps business users with modules focused on adopting cloud models and tools for better managing the business through cloud-based services.

[Solution architects](/learn/browse/?roles=solution-architect) can access hundreds of modules and learning paths. The available topics range from core infrastructure services to advanced data transformation.

[Administrators](/learn/browse/?roles=administrator) have access to modules that focus on Azure fundamentals, configuring containers, or even advanced administration in the cloud.

[Developers](/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=infrastructure) play an important role in the migration of assets to the cloud. Learn about ways to help during architecture, governance, modernization activities.

For additional learning path, browse the [Learn catalog](/learn/browse), using the Roles filter to align learning paths with your role.
