# Fusion: How can the cloud advance my business strategy?

It depends... The cloud delivers a number of fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing a number of business strategies. Leveraging cloud based approaches can improve basic business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

The cloud is a very fluid concept that can fill countless needs in many different ways. This expansive capability offers great potential, but also makes it very difficult to answer the question above. To take advance of the cloud's potential, it is important to start with by documenting the business strategy in a way that is understandable to cloud technicians and also palatable to business stakeholders.

## Business Outcome Framework

In the business strategy section of the Fusion framework, we provide tools to capture targeted business value in a cross functional model, that we call the Business Outcome Framework. Those targeted business outcomes can then be mapped to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach the desired state of transformation. 

* Review [sample Business Outcomes](business-outcomes/overview.md). Identify any business outcomes that directly align with the targeted business strategy. Document those in the provided [business outcome excel template](business-outcomes/business-outcome-template.xlsx) to share with internal partners during the Transformation Journey.
* Identify the [learning metrics](learning-metrics.md) that would best represent progress towards the identified business outcomes. It may be necessary to engage the CIO, or members of the IT team, to select relevant metrics based on the current environment.
* Establish a [Financial Model](financial-models.md) that aligns with the outcomes and learning metrics.
* Document the [Digital Estate](../digital-estate/overview.md) in the current environment to populate the financial model. This will establish investment criteria, time to break even, and return on investment (ROI)

This process allows for a conversation across IT and the business to clearly specify ways that the cloud can advance a  business strategy. For proper representation during this process, it may be wise to first assemble a [[Cloud Strategy Team](../culture-strategy/what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md)](../culture-strategy/what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md), which is a cross functional team that can accurately represent each of the topics above.

## Additional Business Strategy tools

[Risk Tolerance](risk-tolerance.md): Regardless of the chosen business outcomes, it is imperative to document the businesses risks associated with a cloud transformation and the tolerance for risk that the business is comfortable with. These risk tolerances will allow the business to inform and guide IT strategy regardless of the technical implementation.

[Cloud Accounting](cloud-accounting.md) Cost accounting changes when moving assets to the cloud. Since the use (or consumption) of cloud assets is based on a pay-per-use model, costs can more directly be associated with the business unit or team that is benefiting from those resources. This approach creates opportunities to implement new cost accounting models. When multiple teams or business units are undergoing Cloud Transformations, Cloud Accounting can help create clarity regarding the costs and ROI of various efforts.
