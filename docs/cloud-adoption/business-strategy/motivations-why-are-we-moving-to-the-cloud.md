# CAF: Why are we moving to the cloud?

"Why are we moving to the cloud?" is an extremely common question for business and technical stakeholders alike.
If the answer is "Our board (or CIO, or C-suite) told us to move to the cloud", it is unlikely that the business will experience the desired outcomes.

In this article, we will discuss a few motivations behind cloud migration that could produce more significant business outcomes. These options are designed to help facilitate a conversation regarding motivations and ultimately business outcomes.

## Common Motivations for Cloud Transformation

The following is a list of common motivations for cloud adoption

- Unclear direction from board or others at an executive level
- Critical Business Event
  - Data center exit
  - Mergers, acquisition or divestiture
  - Reductions in capital expenses
  - End of support for mission-critical technologies
- Cost Savings
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity
- Optimization of internal operations
- Increase business agility
- Prepare for new technical capabilities
- Build new technical capabilities
- Scale to meet market demands
- Scale to meet geographic demands
- Improve customer experiences / engagements
- Transform products or services

There are technical strategies to execute against each of these motivations. However, the further down the list a specific motivation is, the more likely the business is to experience positive business outcomes as a result of the transformation efforts. This is expanded on in the next section on evolving the IT worldview.

## Business outcome-driven adoption strategies

**Migrate:** The motivations near the top of the list above are the most common (but not necessarily the most significant) reasons for adopting the cloud. These are each important outcomes to achieve, but are most effectively used as a means of transitioning to other more effective worldviews in the future. This important first step to cloud adoption is often called a cloud migration, this framework refers to the strategy behind execution of such a migration by the verb [Migrate](../getting-started/migrate.md).

The motivations that align well with a migrate strategy are as follows. The motives at the top of the list are likely to have significantly less business impact than those that fall closer to the bottom of the list.

- Unclear direction from board or others at an executive level
- Critical business event
  - Data center exit
  - Mergers, acquisition or divestiture
  - Reductions in capital expenses
  - End of support for mission-critical technologies
- Cost savings
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity
- Optimization of internal operations
- Increase business agility
- Prepare for new technical capabilities

**Innovate:** Data is the new commodity... Modern apps are the supply chain that drives that data into various experiences... In today's business market, its hard to find a transformative product or service that isn't built on top of data, insights, and customer experiences. The motivations that fall later in the list align to a technology strategy that this framework refers to simply as [Innovate](../getting-started/innovate.md).

The following are a list of the motivations that would make an IT organization focus more on an innovate strategy than a migrate strategy.

- Increase business agility
- Prepare for new technical capabilities
- Build new technical capabilities
- Scale to meet market demands
- Scale to meet geographic demands
- Improve customer experiences / engagements
- Transform products or services
