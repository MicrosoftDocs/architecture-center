# Why are we moving to the cloud?

"Why are we moving to the cloud?" is a common question for business and technical stakeholders alike.
If the answer is "Our board (or CIO, or C-suite) told us to move to the cloud", it is unlikely that the business will experience the desired outcomes.

In this article, we will discuss a few motivations behind cloud migration that could produce more significant business outcomes. These options are designed to help facilitate a conversation regarding motivations and ultimately business outcomes.

## Common motivations for cloud transformation

Common motivations for cloud adoption include:

- Unclear direction from board or others at an executive level.
- Critical business events, such as:
  - Datacenter exit.
  - Mergers, acquisitions, or divestiture.
  - Reductions in capital expenses.
  - End of support for mission-critical technologies.
- Cost savings.
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity.
- Optimization of internal operations.
- Increasing business agility.
- Preparation for new technical capabilities.
- Building new technical capabilities.
- Scaling to meet market demands.
- Scaling to meet geographic demands.
- Improving customer experiences and engagements.
- Transforming products or services.

There are technical strategies to execute against each of these motivations. However, the further down the list a specific motivation is, the more likely the business is to experience positive business outcomes as a result of the transformation efforts. This is expanded on in the next section on evolving the IT worldview.

## Business outcome-driven adoption strategies

**Migrate:** The motivations near the top of the list above are the most common (but not necessarily the most significant) reasons for adopting the cloud. These are important outcomes to achieve, but are most effectively used as a means of transitioning to other more effective worldviews in the future. This important first step to cloud adoption is often called a cloud migration, this framework refers to the strategy behind execution of such a migration by the verb [Migrate](../getting-started/migrate.md).

The motivations that align well with a migrate strategy are listed below. The motives at the top of the list are likely to have significantly less business impact than those that fall closer to the bottom of the list.

- Unclear direction from board or others at an executive level.
- Critical business events, such as:
  - Datacenter exit.
  - Mergers, acquisitions, or divestiture.
  - Reductions in capital expenses.
  - End of support for mission-critical technologies.
- Cost savings.
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity.
- Optimization of internal operations.
- Increasing business agility.
- Preparing for new technical capabilities.

**Innovate:** Data is the new commodity. Modern apps are the supply chain that drives that data into various experiences. In today's business market, it's hard to find a transformative product or service that isn't built on top of data, insights, and customer experiences. The motivations that fall later in the list align to a technology strategy that this framework refers to as [Innovate](../getting-started/innovate.md).

The following are a list of the motivations that would make an IT organization focus more on an innovate strategy than a migrate strategy.

- Increasing business agility.
- Preparing for new technical capabilities.
- Building new technical capabilities.
- Scaling to meet market demands.
- Scaling to meet geographic demands.
- Improving customer experiences and engagements.
- Transforming products or services.
