# Fusion: Examples of Agility Outcomes

As discussed in [Business Outcomes](overview.md), there are several potential business outcomes that can serve as the foundation for any Transformation Journey conversation with the business. In this article we will focus on the timeliest business measures: Business Agility. Understanding the company’s market position and competitive landscape will help to better articulate the business outcomes that are the target of a business’ Transformation Journey.

Historically, CIOs and IT teams have been seen as a source of stability in core mission critical processes. This is still the case. Few businesses can function well when their IT platform is unstable. However, in today’s business world much more is expected. IT can expand beyond a simple cost center by partnering with the business to provide market advantages. Many CIOs & executives assume that stability is simply a baseline for IT. For these leaders Business Agility is the measure of IT’s contribution to the business.

## Why is Agility so important?

Markets change at a faster pace than ever before. As of 2015, only 57 companies were still in the Fortune 500 61 years later. That an 88.6% turnover rate. This represents market change at a previously unheard-of rate. IT agility or even business agility are unlikely to impact an organization listing on the Fortune 500, but these figures help us understand the pace at which markets continue to change.

For incumbents and upstarts alike, business agility can be the difference between success or failure of a business initiative. Quickly adapting to market changes can help ring fence existing customers or claim market share from competitors. The following are agility related outcomes that can help communicate the value of the cloud during a transformation.

## Time to market Outcome

During Incremental Transformations or Disruptive Transformations, time to market is a key measure of IT’s ability to address market change. In many cases, a business leader may have existing budget for the creation of application or launch of a new product. Clearly communicating a Time to Market benefit could motivate that leader to redirect budget to IT’s Transformation Journey.

* Example 1: The European division of a US based company needs to comply with GDPR regulations by protecting customer data in a database which supports UK operations. The existing version of SQL doesn’t support the necessary row-level security. An in-place upgrade would be too much of a disruption to service. Leveraging Azure SQL to replicate & upgrade the DB, the customer adds the necessary compliance measure in a matter of X weeks.
* Example 2: A logistics company has discovered an untapped segment of the market but will need a new version of their flagship application to capture this market share. Their larger competitor has made the same discovery. Through the execution of an Incremental Transformation, the logistics company embraces a customer obsession and a devops driven development approach to beat their slower, legacy competitor by x months. This jump on market entrance secured the customer base.

## Provision time

When business demands new IT services or scale to existing services, acquisition and provision of new hardware or virtual resources can take weeks. In a mature Operational Transformation, IT can enable self-service provisioning, allowing the business to scale in hours.

* Example: A Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) customer requires the creation and tear down of hundreds of database clusters per year to fulfill operational demands of the business. The on-prem virtual hosts can provision quickly, but the processes of recovering virtual assets is slow & requires significant time from the team. As such, the legacy on-prem environment suffers from bloat & can seldom keep up with demand. Through a mature Operational Transformation, the IT can learn to provide scripted self-provisioning of resources, with a charge-back approach to billing. Together, this allows the business to move as quickly as they need, but still be accountable for the cost of the resources they demand. Doing so in the cloud, limits deployments only to the business’ budget.
