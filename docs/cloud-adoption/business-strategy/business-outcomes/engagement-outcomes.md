# Examples of customer engagement outcomes

As discussed in the [business outcomes overview](./index.md), several potential business outcomes can serve as the foundation for any transformation journey conversation with the business. This article focuses on a common business measure: customer engagement. Understanding the needs of customers and the ecosystem around customers helps with articulating the business outcomes that are the target of a business's transformation journey.

During cloud-enabled data innovation efforts, customer engagement is assumed. Aggregating data, testing theories, advancing insights, and informing cultural change; each of these disruptive functions requires a high degree of customer engagement. During a cloud-enabled application innovation effort, this type of customer engagement is a maturation goal.

Customer engagement outcomes are all about meeting and exceeding customer expectations. As a baseline for customer engagements, customers assume that products and services are performant and reliable. When they are not, it's easy for an executive to understand the business value of performance and reliability outcomes. For more advanced companies, speed of integrating learnings and observations is a fundamental business outcome.

The following are examples and outcomes related to customer engagement:

## Cycle time

During customer-obsessed transformations, like a cloud-enabled application innovation effort, customers respond from direct engagement and the ability to see their needs met quickly by the development team. Cycle time is a Six Sigma term that refers to the duration from the start to finish of a function. For business leaders who are customer-obsessed and investing heavily in improving customer engagement, cycle time can be a strong business outcome.

- **Example**: A services company that provides business-to-business (B2B) services is attempting to hold on to market share in a competitive market. Customers who've left for a competing service provider have stated that their overly complex technical solution interferes with their business processes and is the primary reason for leaving. In this case, cycle time is imperative. Today, it takes 12 months for a feature to go from request to release. If it's prioritized by the executive team, that cycle can be reduced to six to nine months. Through a cloud-enabled application innovation effort, cloud-native application models and Azure DevOps integration, the team was able to cut cycle time down to one month, allowing the business and application development teams to interact more directly with customers.
