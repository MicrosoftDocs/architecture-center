# CAF: Examples of Customer Engagement Outcomes

As discussed in the [business outcomes overview](./index.md), there are several potential business outcomes that can serve as the foundation for any transformation journey conversation with the business. In this article we will focus on a common business measure: Customer Engagement. Understanding the needs of customers and the ecosystem surrounding customers will help to better articulate the business outcomes that are the target of a business’ transformation journey.

During cloud-enabled data innovation efforts, customer engagement is assumed. Aggregating data, testing theories, advancing insights, and informing cultural change; each of these disruptive functions require a high degree of customer engagement. During  cloud-enabled application innovation effort, this type of customer engagement is a maturation goal to drive towards.

Customer engagement outcomes are all about meeting and exceeding customer expectations. As a baseline for customer engagements, customers assume that products and services are performant and reliable. When they are not, it is easy for an executive to understand the business value of performance and reliability outcomes. For more advanced company’s, speed of integrating learnings and observations is a fundamental business outcome.

The following are examples and outcomes related to customer engagement:

## Cycle time

During customer-obsessed transformations, like a cloud-enabled application innovation effort, customers respond from direct engagement and the ability to see their needs met quickly by the development team. Cycle time is a six-sigma term that refers to the period of time from the start to finish of a function. For business leaders that are customer-obsessed and investing heavily in improving customer engagement, cycle time can be a strong business outcome.

- **Example:** A services company that provides business-to-business (B2B) services is attempting to hold onto market share in a competitive market. Customers that have left for a competing service provider have stated that their overly complex technical solution interferes with their business processes and is the primary reason for leaving. In this case, cycle time is imperative. Today, it takes 12 months for a feature to go from request to release. If it is prioritized by the executive team, that cycle can be reduced to six to nine months. Through a cloud-enabled application innovation effort, cloud native application models and Azure DevOps integration, the team was able to cut cycle time down to one month, allowing the business an app dev teams to interact more directly with customers.

ExakTime
Labor management breaks free of on-premises constraints with cloud technology. With Microsoft Azure, ExakTime is moving toward streamlined agile product development, while the company’s clients enjoy a more robust and easy-to-use product, full of new features. “Now, a developer can sit down at his machine, have an idea, spin up a web service or an Azure instance, test out his idea, point it at test data, and get the concept going. In the time that it would have taken to provision just the stuff to do a test, we can actually write the functionality.”
