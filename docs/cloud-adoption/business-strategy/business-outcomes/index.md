# What business outcomes are associated with transformation journeys?

The most successful transformation journeys start with a business outcome in mind. Cloud adoption can be a costly and time-consuming effort. Fostering the right level of support from IT and other areas of the business is crucial to success. Microsoft's [Business Outcome Framework](../index.md) is designed to help customers identify business outcomes that are concise, defined, and drive observable results/change in business performance, supported by a specific measure.

During any cloud transformation, the ability to speak in terms of Business Outcomes supports transparency and cross functional partnerships. The [Business Outcome Framework](../index.md) starts with a simple template to help technically minded individuals document and gain consensus. This template can be used with several business stakeholders to collect a variety of business outcomes, which could each be influenced by a company’s transformation journey. Feel free to use this template electronically or better still, draw it on a whiteboard to engage business leaders and stakeholders in outcome focused discussions.

To learn more about business outcomes and the business outcome template, check out the article on [documenting business outcomes](how-to-use-the-business-outcome-template.md) or download the [excel template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/business-outcome-template.xlsx).

## Prepare for conversations with different personas

The following are a few business outcomes that tend to trigger conversations with various personas, use these to start a conversation:

- **Finance Leadership:** Increase profitability while driving compliance.
- **Marketing:** Acquire and retain customers, build reputation.
- **Sales:** Accelerate sales, improve customer lifetime value.
- **HR:** Retain, recruit, and empower employees.

# Sample outcomes by category

Speaking in business outcomes can feel like a foreign language to many technically minded individuals. To help ease translation, Microsoft curates a number of business outcome examples in the [Business Outcome Framework](../index.md). Use these samples  to help inspire and demonstrate business outcomes based on actual transformation journeys.

To more quickly find the right business outcomes, they are divided into the following business outcome categories, which tend to drive consensus building conversations across business units:

## Fiscal outcomes

Financial or fiscal performance is the cleanest business outcome for many business leaders, but not the only one.

## Agility outcomes

Today’s fast-changing business environment, places a premium on time. Time to respond to and drive market change is the fundamental measure of business agility.

## Reach outcomes

In a constantly shrinking market, global reach (ability to support global customers and users) can be measured by compliance in geographies that are relevant to the business.

## Customer engagement outcomes

Social marketplaces are redefining winners and losers at an unheard-of pace. Responding to user needs is a key measure of customer engagement.

## Performance outcomes

Performance and reliability are assumed. When either falters, reputation damage can be painful and lasting.

Each of the business outcomes listed in the categories above can help facilitate a business outcome conversation with business and technical team members. However, conversations should not be constrained to these generic samples. Understanding the unique needs of the business and building outcomes to match will maximize the value of a cloud transformation.
