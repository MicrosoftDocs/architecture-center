# CAF: Examples of Performance Outcomes

As discussed in [Business Outcomes](overview.md), there are several potential business outcomes that can serve as the foundation for any Transformation Journey conversation with the business. In this article we will focus on a common business measure: Performance.

In today's technology laden society, customers assume that applications will perform and always be available. When this expectation isn't met, it causes reputation damage that can be very costly and long lasting.

## Performance

The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, such as reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

Transform your business and reduce costs with an energy-efficient infrastructure spanning more than 100 highly secure facilities worldwide, linked by one of the largest networks on earth. Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider&mdash;offering the scale needed to bring applications closer to users around the world, preserving data residency, and providing comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers.

* Example 1: A services company was working with a hosting provider which hosted a number of operational infrastructure assets. Those systems suffered from frequent outages and poor performance. This company migrated their assets to Azure to take advantage of the SLA and performance controls of the cloud. The downtime suffered cost the organization approximately $15,000 per minute of outage. With 4-8 hours of outage per month, it was easy to justify this Organizational Transformation.
* Example 2: A consumer investment company was in the beginning of an Incremental Transformation. Agile processes and DevOps were maturing well, but application performance was very spiky. As a more mature transformation, the company started a program to monitor and automate sizing based on usage demands. Leveraging Azure performance management tools, the company was able to eliminate sizing issues, which resulted in a surprising 5% increase in transactions.

## Reliability

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive since data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

One of IT’s most crucial functions is ensuring corporate data is never lost and that applications stay available, despite server crashes, power outages, or natural disasters. Keep your data safe and recoverable by backing it up to Azure. Azure Backup is a simple solution that decreases your infrastructure costs while giving you enhanced security mechanisms to protect your data against ransomware. With one solution, you can protect workloads running in Azure and on-premises across Linux, Windows, VMware, and Hyper-V. Ensure business continuity by keeping your applications running in Azure. Azure Site Recovery makes it simple for you to test disaster recovery by replicating applications between Azure regions. You can also replicate on-premises VMware and Hyper-V virtual machines and physical servers to Azure to stay available if the primary site goes down. Recover workloads to the primary site when it’s up and running again.

* Example: An oil and gas company uses Azure technologies to implement a full site recovery. The company chose not to fully embracing the cloud for day to day operations, but the DRBC features of cloud still protected their datacenter. As a hurricane formed hundreds of miles away, their implementation partner started recovering the site to Azure. Before the storm touched down, all mission-critical assets were live in Azure, preventing any downtime.
