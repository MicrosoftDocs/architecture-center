# Rehost an on-premises Linux app to Azure VMs

This article shows how the fictional company Contoso rehosts a two-tier Linux-based Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) app, using Azure IaaS VMs.

osTicket, the service desk app used in this example is provided as open source. If you'd like to use it for your own testing purposes, you can download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket).

## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with business partners to understand what they want to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth.** Contoso is growing, and as a result there's pressure on the on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Limit risk.** The service desk app is critical for the Contoso business. Contoso wants to move it to Azure with zero risk.
- **Extend.** Contoso don't want to change the app right now. It simply wants to ensure that the app is stable.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for this migration, to determine the best migration method:

- After migration, the app in Azure should have the same performance capabilities as it does today in their on-premises VMware environment. The app will remain as critical in the cloud as it is on-premises.
- Contoso doesnâ€™t want to invest in this app. It is important to the business, but in its current form Contoso simply wants to move it safely to the cloud.
- Contoso doesn't want to change the ops model for this app. It wants to interact with the app in the cloud in the same way that they do now.
- Contoso doesn't want to change app functionality. Only the app location will change.
- Having completed a couple of Windows app migrations, Contoso wants to learn how to use a Linux-based infrastructure in Azure.

## Solution design

After pinning down goals and requirements, Contoso designs and review a deployment solution, and identifies the migration process, including the Azure services that Contoso will use for the migration.

### Current app

- The OSTicket app is tiered across two VMs (**OSTICKETWEB** and **OSTICKETMYSQL**).
- The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5).
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (**contoso-datacenter**), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**)

### Proposed architecture

- Since the app is a production workload, the VMs in Azure will reside in the production resource group **ContosoRG**.
- The VMs will be migrated to the primary region (East US 2) and placed in the production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2):
  - The web VM will reside in the front-end subnet (PROD-FE-EUS2).
  - The database VM will reside in the database subnet (PROD-DB-EUS2).
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

![Scenario architecture](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/architecture.png)

### Solution review

Contoso evaluates the proposed design by putting together a pros and cons list.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Consideration** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Pros** | Both the app VMs will be moved to Azure without changes, making the migration simple.<br/><br/> Since Contoso is using "lift and shift" for both app VMs, no special configuration or migration tools are needed for the app database.<br/><br/> Contoso will retain full control of the app VMs in Azure. <br/><br/> The app VMs are running Ubuntu 16.04-TLS, which is an endorsed Linux distribution. [Learn more](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros).
**Cons** | The web and data tier of the app will remain a single point of failover. <br/><br/> Contoso will need to continue supporting the app as Azure VMs rather than moving to a managed service such as Azure App Service and Azure Database for MySQL.<br/><br/> Contoso is aware that by keeping things simple with a "lift and shift" VM migration, they're not taking full advantage of the features provided by [Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/overview) (built-in high availability, predictable performance, simple scaling, automatic backups and built-in security).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Migration process

Contoso will migrate as follows:

1. As a first step, Contoso sets up the Azure and on-premises infrastructure needed to deploy Site Recovery.
2. After preparing Azure and on-premises components, Contoso sets up and enables replication for the VMs.
3. After replication is working, Contoso migrates the VMs by failing them over to Azure.

![Migration process](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/migration-process.png)

### Azure services

**Service** | **Description** | **Cost**
--- | --- | ---
[Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery) | The service orchestrates and manages migration and disaster recovery for Azure VMs, and on-premises VMs and physical servers. | During replication to Azure, Azure Storage charges are incurred. Azure VMs are created, and incur charges, when failover occurs. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery) about charges and pricing.

## Prerequisites

Here's what Contoso needs for this scenario.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Requirements** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure subscription** | Contoso created subscriptions in an early article in this series. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).<br/><br/> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions.<br/><br/> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.<br/><br/> If you need more granular permissions, review [this article](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control.md).
**Azure infrastructure** | Contoso set up their Azure infrastructure as described in [Azure infrastructure for migration](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md).<br/><br/> Learn more about specific [network](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#network) and [storage](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#storage) requirements for Site Recovery.
**On-premises servers** | The on-premises vCenter server should be running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5<br/><br/> An ESXi host running version 5.5, 6.0 or 6.5<br/><br/> One or more VMware VMs running on the ESXi host.
**On-premises VMs** | [Review Linux machines](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#replicated-machines) that are supported for migration with Site Recovery.<br/><br/> Verify supported [Linux file and storage systems](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#linux-file-systemsguest-storage).<br/><br/> VMs must meet [Azure requirements](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#azure-vm-requirements).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso will complete the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Prepare Azure for Site Recovery.** Contoso creates an Azure storage account to hold replicated data, and creates a Recovery Services vault.
> - **Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery.** Contoso prepares accounts to be used for VM discovery and agent installation, and prepares to connect to Azure VMs after failover.
> - **Step 3: Replicate VMs.** Contoso sets up the source and target migration environment, creates a replication policy, and starts replicating VMs to Azure storage.
> - **Step 4: Migrate the VMs with Site Recovery.** Contoso runs a test failover to make sure everything's working, and then runs a full failover to migrate the VMs to Azure.

## Step 1: Prepare Azure for the Site Recovery service

Contoso needs a couple of Azure components for Site Recovery:

- A new Azure storage account to hold replicated data.
- A Recovery Services vault in Azure.
- A VNet in which failed over resources are located. Contoso already created the VNet during [Azure infrastructure deployment](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md), so they just need to create a storage account and vault.

1. Contoso admins create an Azure storage account (contosovmsacc20180528) in the East US 2 region.

    - The storage account must be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault.
    - They use a general purpose account, with standard storage, and LRS replication.

      ![Site Recovery storage](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/asr-storage.png)

2. With the network and storage account in place, they create a vault (ContosoMigrationVault), and place it in the **ContosoFailoverRG** resource group, in the primary East US 2 region.

    ![Recovery Services vault](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/asr-vault.png)

[Learn about](/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure) setting up Azure for Site Recovery.

## Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery

Contoso admins prepare the on-premises VMware infrastructure as follows:

- They create an account on the vCenter server or vSphere ESXi host, to automate VM discovery.
- They create an account that allows automatic installation of the Mobility service on VMware VMs that you want to replicate.
- They prepare on-premises VMs, so that they can connect to Azure VMs when they're created after migration.

### Prepare an account for automatic discovery

Site Recovery needs access to VMware servers to:

- Automatically discover VMs. At least a read-only account is required.
- Orchestrate replication, failover, and failback. You need an account that can run operations such as creating and removing disks, and turning on VMs.

Contoso admins set up the account as follows:

1. They create a role at the vCenter level.
2. They assign that role the required permissions.

### Prepare an account for Mobility service installation

The Mobility service must be installed on the Linux VMs that will be migrated.

- Site Recovery can do an automatic push installation of this component when replication is enabled for VMs.
- For automatic push installation, they need to prepare an account that Site Recovery will use to access the VMs.
- Accounts details are input during replication setup.
- The account can be domain or local account, with permissions to install on VMs.

### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover

After failover to Azure, Contoso wants to be able to connect to the replicated VMs in Azure. To do this, there's a couple of things that the Contoso admins need to do:

- To access Azure VMs over the internet, they enable SSH on the on-premises Linux VM before migration. For Ubuntu this can be completed using the following command: **Sudo apt-get ssh install -y**.
- After they run the migration (failover), they can check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM.
- If this doesn't work, they'll need to check that the VM is running, and review these [troubleshooting tips](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

- [Learn about](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-mobility-service-installation) creating an account for push installation of the Mobility service.

## Step 3: Replicate the on-premises VMs

Before they can migrate the web VM to Azure, Contoso admins set up and enable replication.

### Set a protection goal

1. In the vault, under the vault name (ContosoVMVault) they set a replication goal (**Getting Started** > **Site Recovery** > **Prepare infrastructure**.
2. They specify that their machines are located on-premises, that they're VMware VMs, and that they want to replicate to Azure.
    ![Replication goal](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/replication-goal.png)

### Confirm deployment planning

To continue, they confirm that they've completed deployment planning, by selecting **Yes, I have done it**. Contoso are only migrating a single VM in this scenario, and don't need deployment planning.

### Set up the source environment

Contoso admins now need to configure the source environment. To do this, they download an OVF template and use it to deploy the Site Recovery configuration server as a highly available, on-premises VMware VM. After the configuration server is up and running, they register it in the vault.

The configuration server runs several components:

- The configuration server component that coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure and manages data replication.
- The process server that acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption; and sends it to Azure storage.
- The process server also installs Mobility Service on VMs you want to replicate and performs automatic discovery of on-premises VMware VMs.

Contoso admins perform these steps as follows:

1. They download the OVF template from **Prepare Infrastructure** > **Source** > **Configuration Server**.

    ![Download OVF](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/add-cs.png)

2. They import the template into VMware to create the VM, and deploy the VM.

    ![OVF template](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/vcenter-wizard.png)

3. When they turn on the VM for the first time, it boots up into a Windows Server 2016 installation experience. They accept the license agreement, and enter an administrator password.
4. After the installation finishes, they sign into the VM as an administrator. At first sign-in, the Azure Site Recovery Configuration Tool runs by default.
5. In the tool, they specify a name to use for registering the configuration server in the vault.
6. The tool checks that the VM can connect to Azure. After the connection is established, they sign in to the Azure subscription. The credentials must have access to the vault in which you want to register the configuration server.

    ![Register configuration server](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/config-server-register2.png)

7. The tool performs some configuration tasks and then reboots.
8. They sign in to the machine again, and the Configuration Server Management Wizard starts automatically.
9. In the wizard, they select the NIC to receive replication traffic. This setting can't be changed after it's configured.
10. They select the subscription, resource group, and vault in which to register the configuration server.

    ![vault](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/cswiz1.png)

11. They then download and install MySQL Server, and VMware PowerCLI.
12. After validation, they specify the FQDN or IP address of the vCenter server or vSphere host. They leave the default port, and specify a friendly name for the vCenter server.
13. They specify the account that they created for automatic discovery, and the credentials that should be used to automatically install the Mobility Service.

    ![vCenter](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/cswiz2.png)

14. After registration finishes, in the Azure portal, they check that the configuration server and VMware server are listed on the **Source** page in the vault. Discovery can take 15 minutes or more.
15. Site Recovery then connects to VMware servers, and discovers VMs.

### Set up the target

Now Contoso admins configure the target replication settings.

1. In **Prepare infrastructure** > **Target**, they select the target settings.
2. Site Recovery checks that there's an Azure storage account and network in the specified target.

### Create a replication policy

After the source and target are set up, they're ready to create a replication policy.

1. In  **Prepare infrastructure** > **Replication Settings** > **Replication Policy** >  **Create and Associate**, they create a policy **ContosoMigrationPolicy**.
2. They use the default settings:
    - **RPO threshold:** Default of 60 minutes. This value defines how often recovery points are created. An alert is generated if continuous replication exceeds this limit.
    - **Recovery point retention:** Default of 24 hours. This value specifies how long the retention window is for each recovery point. Replicated VMs can be recovered to any point in a window.
    - **App-consistent snapshot frequency:** Default of one hour. This value specifies the frequency at which application-consistent snapshots are created.

        ![Create replication policy](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/replication-policy.png)

3. The policy is automatically associated with the configuration server.

    ![Associate replication policy](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/replication-policy2.png)

- [Learn more](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux) about the Azure Guest agent for Linux.

### Enable replication for OSTICKETWEB

Now Contoso admins can start replicating the **OSTICKETWEB** VM.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **+Replicate** they select the source settings.
2. They select that they want to enable virtual machines, select the source settings, including the vCenter server, and the configuration server.

    ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/enable-replication-source.png)

3. They specify the target settings, including the resource group and VNet in which the Azure VM will be located after failover, and the storage account in which replicated data will be stored.

     ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/enable-replication2.png)

4. They select the **OSTICKETWEB** VM for replication.

    - At this stage they select **OSTICKETWEB** only, because the VNet and subnet must both be selected, and the VMs aren't in the same subnet.
    - Site Recovery automatically installs the Mobility service when replication is enabled for the VM.

    ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/enable-replication3.png)

5. In the VM properties, they select the account that's used by the process server to automatically install Mobility Service on the machine.

     ![Mobility service](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/linux-mobility.png)

6. in **Replication settings** > **Configure replication settings**, they check that the correct replication policy is applied, and select **Enable Replication**.

7. They track replication progress in **Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs, the machine is ready for failover.

### Enable replication for OSTICKETMYSQL

Now Contoso admins can start replicating **OSTICKETMYSQL**.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **+Replicate** they select the source and target settings.
2. They select the **OSTICKETMYSQL** VM for replication, and select the account to use for Mobility service installation.

    ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/mysql-enable.png)

3. They apply the same replication policy that was used for OSTICKETWEB, and enable replication.

**Need more help?**

You can read a full walkthrough of all these steps in [Enable replication](/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-enable-replication).

## Step 4: Migrate the VMs

Contoso admins run a quick test failover, and then migrate the VMs.

### Run a test failover

Running a test failover helps ensure that everything's working as expected before the migration.

1. They run a test failover to the latest available point in time (**Latest processed**).
2. They select **Shut down machine before beginning failover**, so that Site Recovery attempts to shut down the source VM before triggering the failover. Failover continues even if shutdown fails.
3. Test failover runs:
    - A prerequisites check runs to make sure all of the conditions required for migration are in place.
    - Failover processes the data, so that an Azure VM can be created. If the latest recovery point is selected, a recovery point is created from the data.
    - An Azure VM is created using the data processed in the previous step.
4. After the failover finishes, the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal. They check that the VM is the appropriate size, that it's connected to the right network, and that it's running.
5. After verifying, they clean up the failover, and record and save any observations.

### Create and customize a recovery plan

 After verifying that the test failover worked as expected, Contoso admins create a recovery plan for migration.

- A recovery plan specifies the order in which failover occurs, how Azure VMs will be brought up in Azure.
- Since they want to migrate a two-tier app, they'll customize the recovery plan so that the data VM (SQLVM) starts before the front-end (WEBVM).

1. In **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** > **+Recovery Plan**, they create a plan and add the VMs to it.

    ![Recovery plan](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/recovery-plan.png)

2. After creating the plan, they select it for customization (**Recovery Plans** > **OsTicketMigrationPlan** > **Customize**.
3. They remove **OSTICKETWEB** from **Group 1: Start**. This ensures that the first start action affects **OSTICKETMYSQL** only.

    ![Recovery group](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/recovery-group1.png)

4. In **+Group** > **Add protected items**, they add **OSTICKETWEB** to **Group 2: Start**. They need these in two different groups.

    ![Recovery group](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/recovery-group2.png)

### Migrate the VMs

Contoso admins are now ready to run a failover on the recovery plan, to migrate the VMs.

1. They select the plan > **Failover**.
2. They select to fail over to the latest recovery point, and specify that Site Recovery should try to shut down the on-premises VM before triggering the failover. They can follow the failover progress on the **Jobs** page.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/failover1.png)

3. During the failover, vCenter Server issues commands to stop the two VMs running on the ESXi host.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/vcenter-failover.png)

4. After the failover, they verify that the Azure VM appears as expected in the Azure portal.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/failover2.png)

5. After verifying the VM in Azure, they complete the migration to finish the migration process for each VM. This stops replication for the VM, and stops Site Recovery billing for the VM.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/failover3.png)

### Connect the VM to the database

As the final step in the migration process, Contoso adins update the connection string of the application to point to the app database running on the **OSTICKETMYSQL** VM.

1. They make an SSH connection to the **OSTICKETWEB** VM using Putty or another SSH client. The VM is private so they connect using the private IP address.

    ![Connect to database](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/db-connect.png)

    ![Connect to database](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/db-connect2.png)

2. They need to make sure that the **OSTICKETWEB** VM can communicate with the **OSTICKETMYSQL** VM. Currently the configuration is hardcoded with the on-premises IP address 172.16.0.43.

    **Before the update:**

    ![Update IP](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/update-ip1.png)

    **After the update:**

    ![Update IP](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/update-ip2.png)

3. They restart the service with **systemctl restart apache2**.

    ![Restart](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm/restart.png)

4. Finally, they update the DNS records for **OSTICKETWEB** and **OSTICKETMYSQL**, on one of the Contoso domain controllers.

    ![Update DNS](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-linux-vm-mysql/update-dns.png)

## Clean up after migration

With migration complete, the osTicket app tiers are now running on Azure VMs.

Now, Contoso needs to clean up as follows:

- Remove the on-premises VMs from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove the on-premises VMs from local backup jobs.
- Update their internal documentation to show the new location, and IP addresses for OSTICKETWEB and OSTICKETMYSQL.
- Review any resources that interact with the VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.
- Contoso used the Azure Migrate service with dependency mapping to assess the VMs for migration. Admins should remove the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, and the Dependency Agent they installed for this purpose, from the VM.

## Review the deployment

With the app now running, Contoso needs to fully operationalize and secure their new infrastructure.

### Security

The Contoso security team review the OSTICKETWEB and OSTICKETMYSQLVMs to determine any security issues.

- The team reviews the network security groups (NSGs) for the VMs to control access. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the application can pass.
- The team also considers securing the data on the VM disks using Disk encryption and Azure Key Vault.

[Read more](/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms) about security practices for VMs.

### BCDR

For business continuity and disaster recovery, Contoso takes the following actions:

- **Keep data safe.** Contoso backs up the data on the VMs using the Azure Backup service. [Learn more](/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
- **Keep apps up and running.** Contoso replicates the app VMs in Azure to a secondary region using Site Recovery. [Learn more](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-quickstart).

### Licensing and cost optimization

- After deploying resources, Contoso assigns Azure tags as defined during the [Azure infrastructure deployment](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md#set-up-tagging).
- Contoso has no licensing issues with the Ubuntu servers.
- Contoso will enable Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary. It's a multicloud cost management solution that helps you to use and manage Azure and other cloud resources. [Learn more](/azure/cost-management/overview) about Azure Cost Management.
