# Rehost an on-premises app to Azure VMs

This article demonstrates how the fictional company Contoso rehosts a two-tier Windows .NET front-end app running on VMware VMs, by migrating the app VMs to Azure VMs.

The SmartHotel360 app used in this example is provided as open source. If you'd like to use it for your own testing purposes, you can download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360).

## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with business partners to understand what they want to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth.** Contoso is growing, and as a result there is pressure on their on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Limit risk.** The SmartHotel360 app is critical for the Contoso business. It wants to move the app to Azure with zero risk.
- **Extend.** Contoso doesn't want to modify the app, but does want to ensure that it's stable.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for this migration. These goals are used to determine the best migration method:

- After migration, the app in Azure should have the same performance capabilities as it does today in VMware. The app will remain as critical in the cloud as it is on-premises.
- Contoso doesnâ€™t want to invest in this app. It is important to the business, but in its current form Contoso simply wants to move it safely to the cloud.
- Contoso doesn't want to change the ops model for this app. Contoso do want to interact with it in the cloud in the same way that they do now.
- Contoso doesn't want to change any app functionality. Only the app location will change.

## Solution design

After pinning down goals and requirements, Contoso designs and review a deployment solution, and identifies the migration process, including the Azure services that Contoso will use for the migration.

### Current app

- The app is tiered across two VMs (**WEBVM** and **SQLVM**).
- The VMs are located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5).
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (contoso-datacenter), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).

### Proposed architecture

- Since the app is a production workload, the app VMs in Azure will reside in the production resource group ContosoRG.
- The app VMs will be migrated to the primary Azure region (East US 2) and placed in the production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2).
- The web front-end VM will reside in the front-end subnet (PROD-FE-EUS2) in the production network.
- The database VM will reside in the database subnet (PROD-DB-EUS2) in the production network.
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

![Scenario architecture](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/architecture.png)

### Database considerations

As part of the solution design process, Contoso did a feature comparison between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server. The following considerations helped them to decide to go with SQL Server running on an Azure IaaS VM:

- Using an Azure VM running SQL Server seems to be an optimal solution if Contoso needs to customize the operating system or the database server, or if it might want to colocate and run third-party apps on the same VM.
- With Software Assurance, in future Contoso can exchange existing licenses for discounted rates on a SQL Database Managed Instance using the Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server. This can save up to 30% on Managed Instance.

### Solution review

Contoso evaluates the proposed design by putting together a pros and cons list.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Consideration** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Pros** | Both the app VMs will be moved to Azure without changes, making the migration simple.<br/><br/> Since Contoso is using "lift and shift" for both app VMs, no special configuration or migration tools are needed for the app database.<br/><br/> Contoso can take advantage of their investment in Software Assurance, using the Azure Hybrid Benefit.<br/><br/> Contoso will retain full control of the app VMs in Azure.
**Cons** | WEBVM and SQLVM are running Windows Server 2008 R2. The operating system is supported by Azure for specific roles (July 2018). [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines).<br/><br/> The web and data tiers of the app will remain a single point of failover.<br/><br/> SQLVM is running on SQL Server 2008 R2 which isn't in mainstream support. However it is supported for Azure VMs (July 2018). [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/help/956893).<br/><br/> Contoso will need to continue supporting the app as Azure VMs rather than moving to a managed service such as Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Migration process

Contoso will migrate the app front-end and database VMs to Azure VMs with the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool agentless method. 

- As a first step, Contoso prepares and sets up Azure components for Azure Migrate Server Migration, and prepares the on-premises VMware infrastructure.
- They already have the [Azure infrastructure](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) in place, so Contoso just needs to add configure the replication of the VMs through the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool. 
- With everything prepared, Contoso can start replicating the VMs.
- After replication is enabled and working, Contoso will migrate the VM by failing it over to Azure.

### Azure services

**Service** | **Description** | **Cost**
--- | --- | ---
[Azure Migrate Server Migration](/azure/migrate/contoso-migration-rehost-vm) | The service orchestrates and manages migration of your on-premises apps and workloads, and AWS/GCP VM instances. | During replication to Azure, Azure Storage charges are incurred. Azure VMs are created, and incur charges, when failover occurs. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-migrate/) about charges and pricing.

## Prerequisites

Here's what Contoso needs to run this scenario.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

**Requirements** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure subscription** | Contoso created subscriptions in an earlier article in this series. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).<br/><br/> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions.<br/><br/> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.<br/><br/> If you need more granular permissions, review [this article](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control).
**Azure infrastructure** | [Learn how](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md) Contoso set up an Azure infrastructure.<br/><br/> Learn more about specific [prerequisites](/azure/migrate/contoso-migration-rehost-vm#prerequisites) requirements for Azure Migrate Server Migration.
**On-premises servers** | On-premises vCenter Servers should be running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5<br/><br/> ESXi hosts should run version 5.5, 6.0 or 6.5<br/><br/> One or more VMware VMs should be running on the ESXi host.

## Scenario steps

Here's how Contoso admins will run the migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 1: Prepare Azure for Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They add the Server Migration tool to their Azure Migrate project. 
> - **Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They prepare accounts for VM discovery, and prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover.
> - **Step 3: Replicate VMs.** They set up replication, and start replicating VMs to Azure storage.
> - **Step 4: Migrate the VMs with Azure Migrate Server Migration.** They run a test failover to make sure everything's working, and then run a full failover to migrate the VMs to Azure.

## Step 1: Prepare Azure for the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool

Here are the Azure components Contoso needs to migrate the VMs to Azure:

- A VNet in which Azure VMs will be located when they're created during failover.
- The Azure Migrate Server Migration tool provisioned. 

They set these up as follows:

1. Set up a network-Contoso already set up a network that can be for Azure Migrate Server Migration when they [deployed the Azure infrastructure](contoso-migration-infrastructure.md)

    - The SmartHotel360 app is a production app, and the VMs will be migrated to the Azure production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2) in the primary East US 2 region.
    - Both VMs will be placed in the ContosoRG resource group, which is used for production resources.
    - The app front-end VM (WEBVM) will migrate to the front-end subnet (PROD-FE-EUS2), in the production network.
    - The app database VM (SQLVM) will migrate to the database subnet (PROD-DB-EUS2), in the production network.


2. Provision the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool-With the network and storage account in place, Contoso now creates a Recovery Services vault (ContosoMigrationVault), and places it in the ContosoFailoverRG resource group in the primary East US 2 region.

### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover

After failover, Contoso wants to connect to the Azure VMs. To do this, Contoso admins do the following before migration:

1. For access over the internet, they:

    - Enable RDP on the on-premises VM before failover.
    - Ensure that TCP and UDP rules are added for the **Public** profile.
    - Check that RDP is allowed in **Windows Firewall** > **Allowed Apps** for all profiles.

2. For access over site-to-site VPN, they:

    - Enable RDP on the on-premises machine.
    - Allow RDP in the **Windows Firewall** -> **Allowed apps and features**, for **Domain and Private** networks.
    - Set the operating system's SAN policy on the on-premises VM to **OnlineAll**.

In addition, when they run a failover they need to check the following:

- There should be no Windows updates pending on the VM when triggering a failover. If there are, they won't be able to log into the VM until the update completes.
- After failover, they can check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM. If this doesn't work, they should verify that the VM is running, and review these [troubleshooting tips](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

## Step 3: Replicate the on-premises VMs

Before Contoso admins can run a migration to Azure, they need to set up and enable replication.

With discovery completed, you can begin replication of VMware VMs to Azure.

1. In the Azure Migrate project > **Servers**, **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**, click **Replicate**.

    ![Replicate VMs](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/select-replicate.png)

2. In **Replicate**, > **Source settings** > **Are your machines virtualized?**, select **Yes, with VMware vSphere**.
3. In **On-premises appliance**, select the name of the Azure Migrate appliance that you set up > **OK**. 

    ![Source settings](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/source-settings.png)

4. In **Virtual machines**, select the machines you want to replicate.
    - If you've run an assessment for the VMs, you can apply VM sizing and disk type (premium/standard) recommendations from the assessment results. To do this, in **Import migration settings from an Azure Migrate assessment?**, select the **Yes** option.
    - If you didn't run an assessment, or you don't want to use the assessment settings, select the **No** options.
    - If you selected to use the assessment, select the VM group, and assessment name.

    ![Select assessment](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/select-assessment.png)

5. In **Virtual machines**, search for VMs as needed, and check each VM you want to migrate. Then click **Next: Target settings**.


6. In **Target settings**, select the subscription, and target region to which you'll migrate, and specify the resource group in which the Azure VMs will reside after migration. In **Virtual Network**, select the Azure VNet/subnet to which the Azure VMs will be joined after migration.
7. In **Azure Hybrid Benefit**:

    - Select **No** if you don't want to apply Azure Hybrid Benefit. Then click **Next**.
    - Select **Yes** if you have Windows Server machines that are covered with active Software Assurance or Windows Server subscriptions, and you want to apply the benefit to the machines you're migrating. Then click **Next**.


8. In **Compute**, review the VM name, size, OS disk type, and availability set. VMs must conform with [Azure requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-vmware#agentless-migration-vmware-vm-requirements).

    - **VM size**: If you're using assessment recommendations, the VM size dropdown will contain the recommended size. Otherwise Azure Migrate picks a size based on the closest match in the Azure subscription. Alternatively, pick a manual size in **Azure VM size**. 
    - **OS disk**: Specify the OS (boot) disk for the VM. The OS disk is the disk that has the operating system bootloader and installer. 
    - **Availability set**: If the VM should be in an Azure availability set after migration, specify the set. The set must be in the target resource group you specify for the migration.

9. In **Disks**, specify whether the VM disks should be replicated to Azure, and select the disk type (standard SSD/HDD or premium-managed disks) in Azure. Then click **Next**.
    - You can exclude disks from replication.
    - If you exclude disks, won't be present on the Azure VM after migration. 


10. In **Review and start replication**, review the settings, and click **Replicate** to start the initial replication for the servers.

> [!NOTE]
> You can update replication settings any time before replication starts, in **Manage** > **Replicating machines**. Settings can't be changed after replication starts.



## Step 4: Migrate the VMs

Contoso admins run a quick test failover, and then a full failover to migrate the VMs.

### Run a test failover

1. In **Migration goals** > **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**, click **Test migrated servers**.

     ![Test migrated servers](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/test-migrated-servers.png)

2. Right-click the VM to test, and click **Test migrate**.

    ![Test migration](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/test-migrate.png)

3. In **Test Migration**, select the Azure VNet in which the Azure VM will be located after the migration. We recommend you use a non-production VNet.
4. The **Test migration** job starts. Monitor the job in the portal notifications.
5. After the migration finishes, view the migrated Azure VM in **Virtual Machines** in the Azure portal. The machine name has a suffix **-Test**.
6. After the test is done, right-click the Azure VM in **Replicating machines**, and click **Clean up test migration**.

    ![Clean up migration](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/clean-up.png)


### Migrate the VMs

Now Contoso admins run a full failover to complete the migration.

1. In the Azure Migrate project > **Servers** > **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**, click **Replicating servers**.

    ![Replicating servers](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm/replicating-servers.png)

2. In **Replicating machines**, right-click the VM > **Migrate**.
3. In **Migrate** > **Shut down virtual machines and perform a planned migration with no data loss**, select **Yes** > **OK**.
    - By default Azure Migrate shuts down the on-premises VM, and runs an on-demand replication to synchronize any VM changes that occurred since the last replication occurred. This ensures no data loss.
    - If you don't want to shut down the VM, select **No**
4. A migration job starts for the VM. Track the job in Azure notifications.
5. After the job finishes, you can view and manage the VM from the **Virtual Machines** page.

## Clean up after migration

With migration complete, the SmartHotel360 app tiers are now running on Azure VMs.

Now, Contoso needs to complete these cleanup steps:

- After the migration is complete, stop replication. 
- Remove the WEBVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove the SQLVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- Remove WEBVM and SQLVM from local backup jobs.
- Update internal documentation to show the new location, and IP addresses for the VMs.
- Review any resources that interact with the VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.

## Review the deployment

With the app now running, Contoso now needs to fully operationalize and secure it in Azure.

### Security

The Contoso security team reviews the Azure VMs, to determine any security issues.

- To control access, the team reviews the network security groups (NSGs) for the VMs. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the app can reach it.
- The team also consider securing the data on the disk using Azure Disk Encryption and Key Vault.

[Read more](/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms) about security practices for VMs.

## BCDR

For business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), Contoso takes the following actions:

- Keep data safe: Contoso backs up the data on the VMs using the Azure Backup service. [Learn more](/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).
- Keep apps up and running: Contoso replicates the app VMs in Azure to a secondary region using Site Recovery. [Learn more](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-quickstart).

### Licensing and cost optimization

1. Contoso has existing licensing for their VMs, and will take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit. Contoso will convert the existing Azure VMs, to take advantage of this pricing.
2. Contoso will enable Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary. It's a multicloud cost management solution that helps to use and manage Azure and other cloud resources. [Learn more](/azure/cost-management/overview) about Azure Cost Management.

## Conclusion

In this article, Contoso rehosted the SmartHotel360 app in Azure by migrating the app VMs to Azure VMs using the Azure Migrate Server Migration tool.
