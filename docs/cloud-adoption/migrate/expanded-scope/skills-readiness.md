# Skills readiness for cloud migration

During a cloud migration, it is very likely that employees, and even some incumbent systems integration partners or managed services partners, will need to develop new skills to be effective during migration efforts. This is amongst the most common scope expansions beyond the [Azure migration guide](../azure-migration-guide/index.md).

## General scope expansion

This scope expansion outlines a number of tools that will help prepare staff for activities within each migration process.

## Prerequisites skilling resources

Before beginning migration efforts, there are a number of fundamental readiness topics the team should investigate.

- [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account): The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services you provision and handles your personal settings like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal): Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Introduction to Azure](/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure): Get started with Azure by creating and configuring your first virtual machine in the cloud.
- [Introduction to security in Azure](/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure): Discuss the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.
- [Manage resources in Azure](/learn/paths/manage-resources-in-azure): Learn how to work with the Azure command line and web portal to create, manage, and control cloud-based resources.
- [Create a VM](/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure): Create a virtual machine using the Azure portal.
- [Azure Networking](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-networking): Learn some of the Azure networking basics and how Azure networking helps improve resiliency and reduce latency.
- [Azure Compute Options](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute): Review the Azure compute services.
- [Secure resources with RBAC](/learn/modules/secure-azure-resources-with-rbac): Use RBAC to secure resources.
- [Data Storage options](/learn/modules/intro-to-data-in-azure/index): Benefits of Azure data storage.

## Assess skilling resources

The following tools can aid the team in execution of assess activities:

- [Balance the portfolio](./balance-the-portfolio.md): Ensure balance and proper investment allocations across an application portfolio.
- [Build a business justification](../../business-strategy/cloud-migration-business-case.md): Create and understand the business justification driving the cloud migration effort.
- [Rationalize the digital estate](../../digital-estate/rationalize.md): Rationalize assets in the digital estate.
- [Application portfolio assessment](/learn/modules/app-and-infra-migration-and-modernization): Criteria for making decisions regarding migration or innovation options within the application portfolio.

## Migrate skilling resources

The following tutorial can prepare the team for migration activities:

- [Migrate to Azure](/azure/site-recovery/migrate-tutorial-on-premises-azure): Using Azure Site Recovery to migrate VMs to Azure.

## Optimize and promote process changes

The following tools can help the team optimize resources and promote to production:

- [Cost and sizing](../azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-costs.md): Adjust sizing to align costs and budgets.
- [Promote a workload](../azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-networking.md): Change network configuration to reroute production users to migrated workloads.

## Secure and manage process changes

The following tools can help the team find ways to secure and manage migrated assets:

- [Secure and manage workloads in Azure](../azure-best-practices/migrate-best-practices-security-management.md): Best practices for securing and managing workloads in Azure.
