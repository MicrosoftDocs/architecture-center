# Secure and manage

After migrating your environment to Azure, it's important to consider the security and methods used to manage the environment. Azure provides many features and capabilities to meet these needs in your solution.

# [Azure Monitor](#tab/monitor)

Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.

## Use and configure Azure Monitor

1. Go to **Monitor** in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **Metrics**, **Logs**, or **Service Health** for overviews.
3. Select any of the relevant insights.

# [Azure Service Health](#tab/servicehealth)

Azure Service Health provides personalized guidance and support when issues in Azure services affect you. It can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you updated as the issue resolves. It can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.

Azure Service Health includes:

- **Azure Status:** A global view of the health of Azure services.
- **Service Health:** A personalized view of the health of your Azure services.
- **Resource Health:** A deeper view of the health of the individual resources provisioned to you by your Azure services.

Combined, these experiences give you a comprehensive view of Azure health, at a level of detail relevant to you.

## Access Service Health

1. Go to **Monitor** in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **Service Health**.

# [Azure Advisor](#tab/advisor)

Azure Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry. It then recommends solutions to help improve the performance, security, and high availability of your resources while looking for opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend.

## Access Azure Advisor

1. Go to **Advisor** in the Azure Portal, or search for the resource
2. Select **High Availability**, **Security**, **Performance**, **Cost**

# [Azure Backup](#tab/backup)

Azure Backup is the Azure-based service you can use to backup (or protect) and restore your data in the Microsoft cloud. Azure Backup replaces your existing on-premises or offsite backup solution with a cloud-based solution that is reliable, secure, and cost-competitive.

## Enable backup for an Azure VM

1. In the Azure portal, select **Virtual machines**, and select the VM you want to replicate.
1. In **Operations**, select **Backup**.
1. Create or select an existing Recovery Services vault.
1. Select **Create (or edit) a new policy**.
1. Configure the schedule and retention period.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Select **Enable Backup**.

# [Azure Site Recovery](#tab/siterecovery)

Earlier in this guide we discussed how Azure Site Recovery service can be used as part of the migration execution, however it also forms a critical component in your disaster recovery strategy.

The Azure Site Recovery service helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.

Site Recovery can manage replication for:

- Azure VMs replicating between Azure regions.
- On-premises VMs, Azure Stack VMs and physical servers.

## Replicate an Azure VM to another region with Site Recovery service

The following steps outline the process to use Site Recovery service to replicate an Azure VM to another region (Azure-to-Azure):

## Enable replication for the Azure VM

1. In the Azure portal, select **Virtual machines**, and select the VM you want to replicate.
1. In **Operations**, select **Disaster recovery**.
1. In **Configure disaster recovery** > **Target region** select the target region to which you'll replicate.
1. For this Quickstart, accept the other default settings.
1. Select **Enable replication**. This starts a job to enable replication for the VM.

## Verify settings

After the replication job has finished, you can check the replication status, modify replication settings, and test the deployment.

1. In the VM menu, select **Disaster recovery**.
2. Verify replication health, the recovery points that have been created, and source and target regions on the map.
