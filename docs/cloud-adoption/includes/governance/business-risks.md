## Objective

The initial objective is to establish a foundation for governance agility. An effective Governance MVP allows the governance team to stay ahead of cloud adoption and implement guardrails as the adoption plan changes.

## Business risks

The company is at an early stage of cloud adoption, experimenting and building proofs of concept. Risks are now relatively low, but future risks are likely to have a significant impact. There is little definition around the final state of the technical solutions to be deployed to the cloud. In addition, the cloud readiness of IT employees is low. A foundation for cloud adoption will help the team safely learn and grow.

**Future-proofing:** There is a risk of not empowering growth, but also a risk of not providing the right protections against future risks.

An agile yet robust governance approach is needed to support the boardâ€™s vision for corporate and technical growth. Failure to implement such a strategy will slow technical growth, potentially risking current and future market share growth. The impact of such a business risk is unquestionably high. However, the role IT will play in those potential future states is unknown, making the risk associated with current IT efforts relatively high. That said, until more concrete plans are aligned, the business has a high tolerance for risk.

This business risk can be broken down tactically into several technical risks:

- Well-intended corporate policies could slow transformation efforts or break critical business processes, if not considered within a structured approval flow.
- The application of governance to deployed assets could be difficult and costly.
- Governance may not be properly applied across an application or workload, creating gaps in security.
- With so many teams working in the cloud, there is a risk of inconsistency.
- Costs may not properly align to business units, teams, or other budgetary management units.
- The use of multiple identities to manage various deployments could lead to security issues.
- Despite current policies, there is a risk that protected data could be mistakenly deployed to the cloud.
