# Fusion: Translate existing roles, skills, and processes for the cloud

At each evolutionary phase during the history of the IT industry, the most notable industry changes are often marked by changes in staff roles. During the transition from mainframes to the client/server model, the role of the computer operator largely disappeared, replaced by the system administrator. When the age of virtualization arrived, the requirement for individuals working with physical servers diminished, replaced with a need for virtualization specialists. Similarly, as institutions shift to cloud computing, roles will likely change again. For example, DataCenter specialists might be replaced with cloud financial analysts. Even in cases where IT job titles have not changed, the daily work roles have evolved significantly. 

IT staff members may feel anxious about their roles and positions as they realize that a different set of skills is needed for the support of cloud solutions. But agile employees who explore and learn new cloud technologies don’t need to have that fear. They can lead the adoption of cloud services and help the organization understand and embrace the associated changes.

## Capturing concerns

During the digital transformation, each team should capture any staff concerns as they arise. When capturing concerns, identify the following:

* The type of concern. For example, workers may be resistant to the changes in job duties that accompany the digital transformation.
* The impact of the concern if it is not addressed. For example, resistance to the digital transformation may be result in workers being slow to execute the changes necessary. 
* The area equipped to address the concern. For example, if workers in the IT department are reluctant to acquire new skills, the IT stakeholder's area is best equipped to address this concern. Identifying the area may be clear for some concerns, and in these cases you may need to escalate to executive leadership. 

## Identify gaps

Another aspect of working through the issues with your enterprise's digital transformation is identifying **gaps**. A gap is a role, skill, or process required for your digital transformation that does not currently exist in your enterprise. 

Begin by enumerating the new responsibilities that accompany the digital transformation, with an emphasis on new responsibilities and current responsibilities to be retired. Identify the area that is aligned with each responsibility. For new responsibilities, determine how closely aligned it is with the area. Some responsibilities may span several areas, and this represents an opportunity for better alignment that should be captured as a concern. In the case where no area is identified as being responsible, capture this as a gap.

Next, identify the skills necessary to support the responsibility. Determine if your enterprise has existing resources with these skills. If there are no existing resources, determine what training programs or talent acquisition is necessary. Determine the time frame by which the responsibility must be supported to keep your digital transformation on track.

Finally, identify the roles that will execute these skills. Some of your existing workforce will assume parts of the role, and in other cases an entirely new role may be necessary.

## Partner across teams

The skills necessary to fill the gaps in your organization's digital transformation will typically not be confined to a single role, or even a single department. Skills will have relationships and dependencies that can span a single role or multiple roles, and those roles may exist in several departments. For example, a workload owner may require someone in an IT role to provision core resources such as subscriptions and resource groups.

These dependencies represent new processes that your organization implements to manage the workflow between roles. In the above example, there are several different types of process that can support the relationship between the workload owner and the IT role. For example, a workflow tool can be created to manage the process, or, a simple email template can be used.

Track these dependencies and make note of the processes that will support them, and whether or not the process currently exists. For process that require tooling, ensure that the timeline for deploying any tools aligns with the overall digital transformation schedule.
