# Fusion: What is a Cloud Strategy Team (CST)?

## Structure of a Cloud Strategy Team

Successful cloud transformation is unique among many technical implementations, in that it must engage business leaders from across the organization. To unite various leaders, it is suggested that executive leadership create a cloud strategy team (CST). This team consists of business leaders from finance, line of business, HR, operations,enterprise architecture, IT infrastructure, and application groups. These teams can help guide critical prioritization and discovery efforts during business transformation.

Digital Transformation, like many forms of business transformation, could trigger changes in business processes, the execution of operations, customer interactions, or even product development. Seldom can digital transformation drive business outcomes, if it is confined to an Information Technology (IT) team. To drive true business change, business leaders must participate in the process. The Cloud Strategy Team provides a means for involving key participants in a manageable construct.

Members of the Cloud Strategy Team should be assigned based on the [Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/overview.md) that best aligns with the current corporate objectives & priorities. The Cloud Strategy Team is often assigned by the CEO and CIO. Assignments are generally based on empowering this team to drive change that cuts across various different organizations within the enterprise.

## Duties of a Cloud Strategy Team

The primary duty of a Cloud Strategy Team is to validate alignment between Business Priorities and the Transformation Journey. However, that primary duty is broad and ambiguous. The following represent a series of tasks usually executed by a Cloud Strategy Team on a monthly basis to help action that primary duty.

**Early Planning Tasks:**

* Review and provide feedback on [Business Outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/overview.md) and [Financial Models](../business-strategy/financial-models.md)
* Aid in establishing clear [motivations for cloud adoption](../business-strategy/motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md) that align with corporate objectives
* Define relevant [Transformation Metrics](../business-strategy/transformation-metrics.md) that clearly communicate progress towards business outcomes
* Understand [business risks](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md) introduced by the plan, represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../business-strategy/risk-tolerance.md)
* Review and approve the [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md)

**On-going Monthly Tasks:**

* Support the Cloud Governance Team during risk/tolerance conversations
* Review release plans to understand timelines and business impact of technical change
* Define Business Change Plans associated with planned releases
* Ensure business teams are ready to execute Business Testing and Business Change Plan

## Cloud Strategy Team cadence

Generally, the tasks mentioned above can be time consuming in the early planning phases. It is advised that each member plan on spending an hour per week to meet with the team. Once the migration plan starts to solidify (usually within 4-6 weeks), the time requirements can often be reduced. Throughout the transformation journey, it is advised that Cloud Strategy Team members plan on investing 1-2 hours per month. Additionally time is likely to be required from delegated members of the executive's team on an as-needed-basis.
