# Fusion

The cloud presents a fundamental shift in the way that enterprises procure and utilize technology resources. In the past, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all levels of technology from infrastructure to software. Now, the cloud offers the potential to transform the way enterprises utilize technology by provisioning and consuming resources as needed.

While the cloud offers nearly unlimited flexibility in terms of design choices, enterprises seek proven and consistent methodology for the adoption of cloud technologies. And, each enterprise has different goals and timelines for cloud adoption, making a one-size-fits-all approach to adoption nearly impossible.

The process of adopting cloud technologies is not a linear process, and this is especially true for large enterprises with many different teams. Some teams may be responsible for a large set of existing workloads and have a requirement to modernize them by adding cloud technologies or migrating them completely. Other teams may have the opportunity to innovate by beginning new development from scratch in the cloud. Yet other teams may not be ready to adopt cloud technologies in production but are ready to learn about and experiment with the cloud.

Each of these different teams requires different approaches to adopting the cloud, but the core knowledge necessary to begin the process is common to all.

## Audience

The content in Fusion impacts the business, technology, and culture of enterprises. A few examples of the roles impacted would include: Line of business (LOB) leaders, Business decision makers (BDMs), IT Decision Makers (ITDMs), Finance, Enterprise Administrators, IT operations, IT security and compliance, IT Governance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners. However, each of these functions and personas speaks a different language. They each have different objectives and KPIs. It's impossible for one content body to interact with each of these audiences directly.

Enter the Cloud Architect: The Cloud Architect serves as the thought leader and facilitator to bring these audiences together. The content in this collection of guides is designed to help the Cloud Architect facilitate the right conversation, with the right audience, to drive necessary decisions. Business transformation that is empowered by the cloud is dependent upon the Cloud Architect role to help guide decisions throughout the business and IT.

Cloud Architect Specializations: Each section of Fusion represents a different specialization or variant of the Cloud Architect role. Those sections also create opportunities to share the cloud architect load amongst a team of cloud architects. Example of a specialization: The Governance section of Fusion is designed for Cloud Architects with a passion for mitigating or cleaning up technical risks. Many cloud providers refer to these specialists as Cloud Custodians, we prefer Cloud Guardian or collectively Cloud Governance Team.

## How to use Fusion

If your enterprise is new to Azure, begin with the [overview](getting-started/overview.md) in the *getting started* section. This document includes prescriptive guidance for your enterprise's digital transformation, walking through each step of the process.

If your enterprise has experience in Azure and is seeking more in-depth guidance and best practices for specific areas, there are sections for [governance](governance/overview.md) and [Decision Guides](infrastructure/overview.md). Additional sections will be released over the next three to six months.
