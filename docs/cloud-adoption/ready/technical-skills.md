# Build technical skills

Cloud adoption requires retooling for some IT roles. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework identifies some of the resources available for building technical skills.

## Migration skill building

During cloud migration efforts, all members of the cloud adoption teams and the cloud strategy team can use Microsoft Learn modules to develop necessary skills.

[Business users](/learn/browse/?roles=business-user) may experience a steep learning curve when asked to participate in planning, testing, and adoption of cloud-based technology. Microsoft Learn helps business users with modules focused on adopting cloud models and tools for better managing the business through cloud-based services.

[Solution architects](/learn/browse/?roles=solution-architect) can access hundreds of modules and learning paths. The available topics range from core infrastructure services to advanced data transformation.

[Administrators](/learn/browse/?roles=administrator) have access to modules that focus on Azure fundamentals, configuring containers, or even advanced administration in the cloud.

[Developers](/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=infrastructure) play an important role in the migration of assets to the cloud. Learn about ways to help during architecture, governance, modernization activities. For developer learning modules beyond infrastructure readiness, [browse all Azure related developer modules](/learn/browse/?roles=developer&products=azure).

In various sections of the Cloud Adoption Framework, specific learning paths and modules are identified to aid the team in making decisions and solving complex adoption problems.
