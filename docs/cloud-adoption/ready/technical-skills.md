# Building Technical Skills

Cloud adoption will require a bit of retooling for a number of IT roles. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework captures some of the resources available for building technical skills.

## Migration Skill Building

During cloud migration efforts all members of the Cloud Adoption Team and Cloud Strategy Team can leverage Microsoft Learn modules to develop necessary skills.

[Business users](/learn/browse/?roles=business-user) can experience a steep learning curve when asked to participate in planning, testing, and adoption of cloud based technology. Microsoft Learn helps business users with modules focused on adopting cloud models and tools for better managing the business through cloud based services.

[Solution architects](/learn/browse/?roles=solution-architect) can access hundreds of modules and learning paths on topics ranging from core infrastructure services to Advanced data transformation in Azure DataBricks.

[Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/?roles=administrator) have access to modules that focus on Azure fundamentals, configuring containers, or even advanced administration in the cloud.

[Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=infrastructure) developers play an important role in the migration of assets to the cloud. Learn about ways to help during architecture, governance, modernization activities.

In various sections of the Cloud Adoption Framework, specific learning paths and modules will be identified to aid the team in making decisions and solving complex adoption problems.
