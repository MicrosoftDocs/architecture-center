# Manage costs and billing for your Azure resources

Cost control is critical to maximize the value of your cloud investment. Use the following sections to learn how to manage costs for your Azure resources.

## Manage your costs with Azure Cost Management

Azure provides a few ways to help you predict and manage costs:

- **Analyze cloud costs** helps you explore and analyze your costs. You can view aggregated cost for your account or view accumulated costs over time.
- **Monitor with budgets** allows you to create a budget and then configure alerts to warn you when you are close to exceeding it.
- **Optimize with recommendations** helps identify idle and underused resources so you can take action to reduce waste.
- **Manage invoices and payments** gives you visibility to your cloud investment.
