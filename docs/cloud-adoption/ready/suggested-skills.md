# Skills readiness path during the Ready phase of a migration journey

During the Ready phase of a migration journey, the objective is to prepare for the journey ahead. This phase is accomplished in two primary areas: organizational readiness and environmental (technical) readiness. Each area might require new skills for both technical and nontechnical contributors. The following sections describe a few options to help build the necessary skills.

## Organizational readiness learning paths

Depending on the motivations and business outcomes associated with a cloud adoption effort, leaders might be required to establish new organizational structures or virtual teams (V-teams) to facilitate various functions. The following articles help to develop the skills that are necessary to structure those teams in accordance with desired outcomes:

- [Initial organization alignment](./index.md): Overview of organizational alignment and various team structures to facilitate specific goals.
- [Break down silos and fiefdoms](../organization/fiefdoms-silos.md): Understand two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide the team to productive collaboration.

## Environmental (technical) readiness learning paths

During the Ready phase, technical staff are called upon to create a migration landing zone that's capable of hosting, operating, and governing workloads that were migrated to the cloud. Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths:

- [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account): The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services you provision and handles your personal settings like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal): Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Introduction to Azure](/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure): Get started with Azure by creating and configuring your first virtual machine in the cloud.
- [Introduction to security in Azure](/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure): Discuss the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.
- [Manage resources in Azure](/learn/paths/manage-resources-in-azure): Learn how to work with the Azure command line and web portal to create, manage, and control cloud-based resources.
- [Create a VM](/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure): Create a virtual machine by using the Azure portal.
- [Azure networking](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-networking): Learn some of the Azure networking basics and how Azure networking helps improve resiliency and reduce latency.
- [Azure compute options](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute): Review the Azure compute services.
- [Secure resources with role-based access control (RBAC)](/learn/modules/secure-azure-resources-with-rbac): Use RBAC to secure resources.
- [Data storage options](/learn/modules/intro-to-data-in-azure/index): Benefits of Azure data storage.

During the Ready phase, architects are called upon to architect solutions that span all Azure environments. The following skill-building resources can prepare architects for these tasks:

- [Foundations for cloud architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to help architect the right foundational solutions.
- [Microsoft Azure architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to ground architects in Azure architecture.
- [Designing migrations for Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to help architects design a migration solution.

## Deeper skills exploration

Beyond these initial options for developing skills, there are a variety of learning options available.

### Typical mappings of cloud IT roles

Microsoft and partners offer a variety of options for all audiences to develop their skills with Azure services:

- [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/product-training/microsoft-azure): Offers training from the people who helped build Azure. Instruction ranges from a basic overview to deep technical training so that IT staff learn how to use Azure for their business.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Cloud Essentials](https://www.microsoft.com/azureessentials): Provides a free annual subscription that includes cloud services, education, and support benefits. IT Pro Cloud Essentials provides IT implementers with hands-on experience and targeted educational opportunities. Subscribers also have access to experts in areas that matter most to increase knowledge and create a path to career advancement.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Career Center](https://www.microsoft.com/itpro): Serves as a free online resource to help map your cloud career path. Learn what industry experts suggest for your cloud role and the skills to get you there. Follow a learning curriculum at your own pace to build the skills you need most to stay relevant.

Turn your knowledge of Azure into official recognition with [Microsoft Azure certification training and exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-certification.aspx).

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn is a new approach to learning. Readiness for the new responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily. Microsoft Learn provides a more rewarding approach to hands-on learning that helps you achieve your goals faster. Earn points and levels and achieve more.

The following examples are a few of the role-specific learning paths on Microsoft Learn:

[Business users](/learn/browse/?roles=business-user) might experience a steep learning curve when they're asked to participate in planning, testing, and adoption of cloud-based technology. Microsoft Learn helps business users with modules that are focused on adopting cloud models and tools for better managing the business through cloud-based services.

[Solution architects](/learn/browse/?roles=solution-architect) can access hundreds of modules and learning paths. The available topics range from core infrastructure services to advanced data transformation.

[Administrators](/learn/browse/?roles=administrator) have access to modules that focus on Azure fundamentals, configuring containers, or even advanced administration in the cloud.

[Developers](/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=infrastructure) play an important role in the migration of assets to the cloud. Learn about ways to help during architecture, governance, and modernization activities.

For additional learning paths, browse the [Learn catalog](/learn/browse). Use the **Roles** filter to align learning paths with your role.
