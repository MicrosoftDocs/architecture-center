# Skills readiness path during the "ready" phase of a migration journey

During the "ready" phase of a migration journey, the objective is to prepare for the journey ahead. This phase is accomplished in two primary areas: organizational readiness and environmental (technical) readiness. Each area may require new skills for both technical and nontechnical contributors. The following are a few options to help build the necessary skills:

## Organizational readiness learning paths

Depending on the motivations and business outcomes associated with a cloud adoption effort, leaders may be required to establish new organizational structures or virtual teams (V-teams) to facilitate various functions. The following articles will help develop the skills necessary to structure those teams in accordance with desired outcomes.

- [Initial organization alignment](./index.md): Overview of organizational alignment and various team structures to facilitate specific goals.
- [Breaking down silos and fiefdoms](../organization/fiefdoms-silos.md): Understanding two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide the team to productive collaboration.

## Environmental (technical) readiness learning paths

During the Ready phase, technical staff will be called upon to create a migration landing zone capable of hosting, operating, and governing workloads that have been migrated to the cloud. Developing the necessary skills can be accelerated with the following learning paths:

- [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account): The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services you provision and handles your personal settings like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal): Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Introduction to Azure](/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure): Get started with Azure by creating and configuring your first virtual machine in the cloud.
- [Introduction to security in Azure](/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure): Discuss the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.
- [Manage resources in Azure](/learn/paths/manage-resources-in-azure): Learn how to work with the Azure command line and web portal to create, manage, and control cloud-based resources.
- [Create a VM](/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure): Create a virtual machine using the Azure portal.
- [Azure Networking](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-networking): Learn some of the Azure networking basics and how Azure networking helps improve resiliency and reduce latency.
- [Azure Compute Options](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute): Review the Azure compute services.
- [Secure resources with RBAC](/learn/modules/secure-azure-resources-with-rbac): Use RBAC to secure resources.
- [Data Storage options](/learn/modules/intro-to-data-in-azure/index): Benefits of Azure data storage.

During the Ready phase, architects will be called upon to architect solutions that span all Azure environments. The following skilling resources can prepare architects for these tasks:

- [Foundations for Cloud Architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to help architect the right foundational solutions.
- [Microsoft Azure Architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to ground architects in Azure Architecture.
- [Designing Migrations for Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): PluralSight course to help architects design a migration solution.

## Deeper skills exploration

Beyond these initial options for developing skills, there are a variety of learning options available.

### Typical mappings of cloud IT roles include

Microsoft and partners offer a variety of options for all audiences to develop their skills with Microsoft Azure services.

- [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/product-training/microsoft-azure): Offers training from the people who helped build Microsoft Azure. From a basic overview to deep technical training, IT staff will learn how to use Microsoft Azure for their business.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Cloud Essentials](https://www.microsoft.com/azureessentials): Provides a free annual subscription that includes cloud services, education, and support benefits. IT Pro Cloud Essentials provides IT implementers with hands-on experience, targeted educational opportunities, and access to experts in areas that matter most to increase knowledge and create a path to career advancement.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Career Center](https://www.microsoft.com/itpro): Serves as a free online resource to help map your cloud career path. Learn what industry experts suggest for your cloud role and the skills to get you there. Follow a learning curriculum at your own pace to build the skills you need most to stay relevant.

We recommend turning knowledge of Microsoft Azure into official recognition with [Microsoft Azure certification training and exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-certification.aspx).

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn is a new approach to learning. Readiness for the new responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily. Microsoft Learn provides a more rewarding approach to hands-on learning that helps you achieve your goals faster. Earn points, levels, and achieve more!

The following are a few examples of role-specific learning paths on Microsoft Learn:

[Business users](/learn/browse/?roles=business-user) may experience a steep learning curve when asked to participate in planning, testing, and adoption of cloud-based technology. Microsoft Learn helps business users with modules focused on adopting cloud models and tools for better managing the business through cloud-based services.

[Solution architects](/learn/browse/?roles=solution-architect) can access hundreds of modules and learning paths. The available topics range from core infrastructure services to advanced data transformation.

[Administrators](/learn/browse/?roles=administrator) have access to modules that focus on Azure fundamentals, configuring containers, or even advanced administration in the cloud.

[Developers](/learn/browse/?roles=developer&term=infrastructure) play an important role in the migration of assets to the cloud. Learn about ways to help during architecture, governance, modernization activities.
