# Cloud readiness in the Cloud Adoption Framework

Coming soon: Getting ready for cloud adoption is more than just building out an Azure Foundation. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework will help readers design a Center of Excellence, develop skills readiness for IT Staff and partner/support alignment, and establish environment readiness.

## Establish an Azure Foundation

Innovate, Migrate, or Enable motions all require a similar foundation in cloud skills and a basic cloud environment. The following image outlines the components of a minimum viable product (MVP) Azure foundation. Environment readiness in this section will be based on the MVP defined in the following image.

## Azure Readiness Guide

As a first step towards the completion of this section, the existing [Azure Readiness Guide](./azure-readiness-guide/index.md) has been pulled into the Cloud Adoption Framework. Over the next 30-60 days, this guide will be updated to align with the Azure Foundation taxonomy and other guidance within the Cloud Adoption Framework.
