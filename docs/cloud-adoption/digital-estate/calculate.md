# Align cost models with the digital estate to forecast cloud costs

Once a digital estate has been rationalized, it can be aligned to equivalent costing models with the chosen cloud provider. Discussing cost models is difficult without focusing on a specific cloud provider. To provide tangible examples in this article, Azure is the assumed cloud provider.

Azure pricing tools help you manage cloud spend with transparency and accuracy, to make the most of Azure and other clouds. Providing the tools to monitor, allocate, and optimize cloud costs, empowers customers to accelerate future investments with confidence.

- [Azure Migrate](/azure/migrate/migrate-overview). Azure Migrate is perhaps the most cost effective approach to cost model alignment. This tool allows for digital estate [inventory](inventory.md), [limited rationalization](rationalize.md), and cost calculations in one tool.

- [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator](https://azure.com/tco). Lower the total cost of ownership of your on-premises infrastructure with the Azure cloud platform. Use the Azure TCO calculator to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your application workloads to Azure. Provide a brief description of your on-premises environment to get an instant report.

- [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing). Estimate your expected monthly bill using our pricing calculator. Track your actual account usage and bill at any time using the billing portal. Set up automatic email billing alerts to be notified if your spend goes above an amount you configure.

- [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cost-management). Azure Cost Management, licensed by Microsoft subsidiary Cloudyn, is a multicloud cost management solution that helps you use and manage Azure and other cloud resources most effectively. Collect cloud usage and billing data through application program interfaces (APIs) from Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. With that data, gain full visibility into resource consumption and costs across cloud platforms in a single, unified view. Continuously monitor cloud consumption and cost trends. Track actual cloud spending against your budget to avoid overspending. Detect spending anomalies and usage inefficiencies. Use historical data to improve your forecasting accuracy for cloud usage and expenditures.
