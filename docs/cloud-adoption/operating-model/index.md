# Operating model for the cloud

Cloud adoption defines "What we do" or "how we use the cloud" during transformation projects that realize the desired business value. The operating model is "who we are" or "how we function on a daily basis", while cloud adoption is being delivered and long after.

## Establish an operating model

For some customers, current operating models can scale to support their desire to adopt the cloud. Other customers have reported nontechnical blockers to cloud adoption that could be solved by a modern operating model. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework is designed to help customers by presenting an actionable operating model to guide nontechnical decisions. This operating model consists of three methodologies that can aid in creation of your own cloud operating model:

- **[Govern](../governance/index.md):** Ensure consistency across adoption efforts. Align to governance or compliance requirements to maintain a well-managed cross-cloud environment.
- **[Organize](../organization/index.md):** Align the organization to ensure success across the operating model and various cloud adoption efforts.
- **[Manage](../operations/index.md):** Alignment of ongoing processes for operational management of the technology to maximize value attainment and minimize disruptions.

## Next steps

Governance is often the first step customer's take towards an operating model for the cloud.
