# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Core Infrastructure overview

One of the most important steps your organization takes on its digital
transformation journey is understanding how cloud platforms work. Knowing how
resources are deployed, organized, managed, and brought into compliance with
your overall governance policies is critical in making the correct architectural
decisions for your migration.

This section of the Enterprise Cloud Adoption guidance will provide a summary of
the most important technologies and models used in designing and building
cloud-based solutions, as well as providing some concrete examples and
prescriptive guidance on building solutions specifically using the Azure public
cloud platform.

## Core infrastructure components

Each of the following components represents one of the key foundational
technologies underlying all cloud deployments. It's important to learn how these
components work and which of their various features and deployment models are
appropriate for your needs.

[Subscriptions](subscriptions/overview.md):
At the root of your cloud deployment's ownership, billing, and management
capabilities is an underlying account or subscription.

[Identity](identity/overview.md):
Identity services are the key mechanism supporting access control within any IT
environment. Cloud-based Identity services can help integrate your existing
Identity resources with cloud deployments.

[Resource Naming and Tagging](resource-naming-and-tagging/overview.md):
Properly organizing your cloud-based resources to support management, access
control, and operational efficiency requires a consistent well-organized naming
and metadata scheme.

[Software Defined Networks](software-defined-networks/overview.md):
Capable of rapid deployment and modification, virtualized networking
capabilities are critical for deploying secure workloads to the cloud. Software
defined networks support agile workflows, are capable of isolating resources,
and can integrate your cloud-based systems with existing IT infrastructure.

[Encryption](encryption/overview.md):
Properly securing sensitive data through encryption is a key aspect of security
within a cloud deployment.

[Logs and Reporting](logs-and-reporting/overview.md):
Successful operations, maintenance, and policy enforcement of cloud deployments
depends monitoring log data generated by cloud-based resources and analyzing
that data to provide useful insights into the status and health of workloads.

## Azure Examples and Guidance

In addition to understanding how cloud platforms work in a general way, planning
a migration to Azure requires learning how core infrastructure components are
used to build solutions on the Azure platform and how to design your deployments
to best meet your organizations goals.

[Deploy a basic
workload](virtual-machines/basic-workload.md):
How do you deploy a simple workload to Azure? This section provides an overview
of the deployment process and links to detailed guidance.

[Can a mainframe be migrated to
Azure?](mainframe-migration/overview.md):
This section guides you through the process and associated considerations for
migrating a mainframe solution to Azure.

[How To: Create Hybrid Cloud
Consistency](misc/hybrid-consistency.md):
A hybrid cloud allows organizations to take advantage of the scalability and
overall flexibility of the cloud while maintaining important services in your
on-premise or other pre-existing IT environments. This section provides
high-level guidance on establishing consistent identity, security, management,
and operations standards across your on-premises and cloud-based resources.

[How To: Build a Virtual
Datacenter](virtual-datacenter/virtual-datacenter-vdc.md):
Building on ideas of cloud consistency, Azure Virtual Datacenter (VDC) is an
approach to helping IT organizations and business units balance governance and
developer agility while deploying enterprise cloud workloads. This section will
provide guidance and examples on how to build a VDC on the Azure platform.
