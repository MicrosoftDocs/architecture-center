# Fusion: Azure Virtual Datacenter -Naming and tagging recommendations

Jump to: [Naming recommendations](#naming-recommendations) | [Tagging](#tagging)

Resource naming standards and tagging policy in the [Azure Virtual Datacenter model](../virtual-datacenter/overview.md) should comply when possible with your existing organization standards and policy, and support your overall subscription design. 

The Azure Virtual Datacenter model does not enforce prescriptive tagging and naming guidance beyond limits described in [Azure naming convention best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions). However, the model does provide recommendations to help make naming and tagging resource groups and individual resources easier to find and manage.  

## Naming recommendations

It is important that resources that you deploy to a VDC are named uniquely and descriptively. At the resource group level, you should use names that include major organizational and structural elements of the VDC. 

Consider the following example:

    [Organization Name]-[Hub/Spoke Name]-[Functional Subsection]-rg

The resource group containing virtual networking resources for the hub should be named something similar to: *contoso-hub1-net-rg*

At the individual resource level:

    [Organization Name]-[Hub/Spoke Name]-[Resource Name]

A network security group (NSG) associated with a hub virtual network's gateway subnet should be named something similar to: *contoso-hub1-gatewaynsg*

Note that some resources, such as Azure Storage accounts, do not allow dashes in their names and have limits to the number of name characters. In these cases, a simplified \[Hub/Spoke Name\]\[Resource Name\] standard (for example, *hub1jbdiagstorage*) is usually adequate to uniquely identify these assets.

The information used in these naming schemes break down as follows:

| Name component       | Description                                                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organization name    | The name of the IT organization responsible for owning and maintaining the VDC                |
| Hub/Spoke name       | Name of the spoke or hub environment where the resources are deployed                         |
| Subsection           | Functional grouping ([resource group](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md)) where the resource is used (network, management, etc.) |
| Resource Name        | The identifier of the individual resource itself                                              |

## Tagging

Tagging policy varies widely across organizations. The Azure Datacenter model does recommended, at a minimum, that you apply the following tags (or their equivalents using your organization's tagging standards) to all assets at either the resource group or individual resource level:

| Tag                  | Description                                                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| environment          | How you use the resource (Dev, UAT, Staging, Prod, etc.)                                       |
| managedBy            | Who the user is or the group responsible for managing the asset                                |
| dataClassification   | How sensitive is the data stored or processed by the resource                                  |
| supportTier          | How rapidly do issues with the resource need to be involved                                    |
| costCenter           | What the associated cost center ID for the resource is                                         |
