# Fusion: Azure Virtual Datacenter - Monitoring and Reporting

Jump to: [Log data](#log-data) | [Azure Monitor](#azure-monitor) | [Azure Active Directory Reports](#azure-active-directory-reports) | [Azure Security Center](#azure-security-center) | [Azure Network Watcher](#azure-network-watcher)

Governance and control of workloads is based not just on collecting log data, but also the ability to trigger actions based on specific reported events. Within the [Azure Virtual Datacenter model](../virtual-datacenter/overview.md), monitoring and reporting capabilities are an important component central IT teams use to ensure VDC hosted assets are in compliance with operational and security policy requirements.

The VDC model uses cloud-based services such as Azure Monitor for monitoring and reporting of Azure-hosted resource activity. As part of any migration planning, you will need to consider how to integrate these services with your existing on-premises monitoring and reporting capability using a hybrid approach.  

## Log data

There are two critical types of [log data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-log-audit) involved in monitoring VDC assets:

- Azure activity logs provide insight into the operations that were performed on resources in your subscription. Activity logs were previously known as “audit logs” or “operational logs,” because they report control-plane events for your subscriptions.
- Azure Diagnostic Logs are logs generated by a deployed resource. They provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. The content of these logs varies by resource type.

For tracking access control and network security in a VDC, it is extremely important to track your VDC virtual network [Network Security Group (NSG) diagnostic logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-nsg-manage-log).

## Azure Monitor

The Azure Virtual Datacenter model assumes the use of [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) as the primary provider of monitoring and reporting services for resources deployed within a VDC. Azure Monitor provides built-in monitoring capabilities across Azure resources, enabling performance metrics and diagnostic logging. Many resources used in a VDC are automatically integrated within Azure Monitor, including SQL Database, NSGs, and Azure Storage.

Azure Monitor allows custom alert rules that can notify admins on security or performance issues, or even trigger specific actions automatically. Azure Monitor provides detailed activity and audit logs for all management operations on Azure resources, such as creating or deleting a resource.

Relevant logs and information generated by Azure monitor are displayed within the Azure portal. In addition, Azure Monitor can also pull in and provide visibility to diagnostic logs generated from other Azure services, disclosing this information within the portal and providing analytics and search capabilities to help interpret this data.

Integrating Azure Monitor data from a VDC with your existing on-premises monitoring and reporting services will differ for every organization. However, Azure Monitor [provides integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-partners) with many popular DevOps, issue management, ITSM, and SIEM tools. You can also build your own custom integration using [Azure Monitor REST APIs](#https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-rest-api-walkthrough) and [webhooks](#https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-webhooks-alerts).

## Azure Active Directory Reports

Azure AD is a critical for securing resources within a VDC and provides a variety of reports for monitoring the security state resources hosted within a VDC. [Azure Active Directory Reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-reports) is a feature of Azure AD that offers the following reports to help with diagnosing security issues:

- Anomaly reports – Shows sign-in events that were found to be anomalous, alerting admins to potentially suspicious activity.
- Integrated Application reports – Contains information on how cloud applications are being used. 
- Error reports – Lists authentication or other AD related errors.
- User-specific reports – Displays device/sign-in activity data for specific users, including administrators and technical users.
- Activity logs – Contains a record of all audited events, as well as group activity changes, password resets, and registration activity. 

## Azure Security Center

[Azure Security Center (ASC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/) is the primary service used to detect security threats or breaches within a VDC, and helps to detect, prevent, and respond to threats to VDC-hosted resources. It provides security monitoring and centralized policy management across Azure subscriptions used in a VDC.

Security policies are defined for resources within a specified subscription or resource group, and ASC alerts the appropriate security teams of any violation of those policies, along with recommendations about its remediation.

ASC can collect, analyze, and fuse log data from compute services, network resources, and partner solutions such as firewalls. This information is used to provide security recommendations or raise security alerts if vulnerabilities are detected. ASC also leverages [Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU)](https://news.microsoft.com/presskits/dcu/), the [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc), along with other external resources to stop attacks and prevent future attacks.

## Azure Network Watcher

[Azure Network Watcher (NW)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/) is an Azure monitoring service used to monitor, diagnose, and gain insights to your VDC's network performance and health. It provides the following features:

- Topology View: visualization of network topologies and the identification of unhealthy connections and resources.
- Diagnostics: including connectivity, latency, DNS check, trace route, IP flow verification, security group views, next hop, and packet capture.
- Performance and Health: including flow analysis, security analysis, bandwidth usage, protocol analyzer, and network subscription limits.
- Logs: configuration and views of all network logs and alerts.
