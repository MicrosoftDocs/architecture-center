# Fusion: Mainframe myths and facts

Mainframes perform prominently in the history of computing, and remain viable for highly specific workloads. Many experts agree that mainframes are a proven platform with long-established operating procedures that can result in reliable and robust environments. Software runs based on usage, measured in million instructions per second (MIPS), and extensive usage reports are available for charge backs.

The reliability, availability, and processing power of mainframes have taken on almost mythical proportions. To evaluate the mainframe workloads that are most suitable for Azure, you first want to distinguish the myths from the reality.

## Myth: Mainframes never go down and have a minimum of five 9s of availability 

Most mainframe hardware and operating systems are viewed as reliable and stable. But the reality is that downtime must be scheduled for maintenance and reboots, which is referred to as initial program loads (IPLs). When you consider IPL tasks, a mainframe solution often has closer to two or three 9s of availability, which is equal to that of high-end, Intel-based servers.

Mainframes also remain as vulnerable to disasters as any servers do, and can require uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to handle these types of failures.

## Myth: Mainframes have limitless scalability 

A mainframe’s scalability depends on the capacity of its system software, such as the customer information control system (CICS), and the capacity of new instances of mainframe engines and storage. Some large companies that use mainframes have customized their CICS for performance, and have otherwise outgrown the capability of the largest available mainframes.

## Myth: Intel-based servers are not as powerful as mainframes 

The new core-dense, Intel-based systems have as much compute capacity as mainframes.

## Myth: The cloud cannot accommodate mission-critical applications for companies, such as large financial institutions 

Although there may be some isolated instances where cloud solutions fall short, it is usually becuase the application algorithms cannot be distributed. These few examples are the exceptions, not the rule.

## Summary

By comparison, Azure offers a cloud platform that is capable of delivering equivalent mainframe functionality and features, and at a much less cost. In addition, the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the cloud’s subscription-based, usage-driven cost model is far less expensive than mainframe computers.
