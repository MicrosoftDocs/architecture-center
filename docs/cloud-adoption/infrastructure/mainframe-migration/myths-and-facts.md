# Fusion: Mainframe myths and facts

Mainframes figure prominently in the history of computing and remain viable for highly specific workloads. Most agree that mainframes are a proven platform with long-established operating procedures that make them reliable, robust environments. Software can run based on usage, measured in million instructions per second (MIPS), and extensive usage reports are available for charge backs.

The reliability, availability, and processing power of mainframes have taken on almost mythical proportions, however. To evaluate the mainframe workloads most suitable for Azure, it helps to distinguish the myths from the reality.

## Myth: Mainframes never go down and have a minimum of five 9s of availability 

Mainframe hardware and operating systems are viewed as reliable and stable.  However, the reality is that downtime must be scheduled for maintenance and reboots (referred to as initial program loads or IPLs). When these tasks are considered, a mainframe solution often has closer to two or three 9s of availability—on par with high-end, Intel-based servers.

In addition, mainframes remain as vulnerable to disasters as any servers and require uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to handle these types of failures.

## Myth: Mainframes have limitless scalability 

In reality, a mainframe’s scalability depends on the capacity of its system software, such as the CICS, and the capacity of new instances of mainframe engines and storage. Some larger companies that use mainframes have customized their CICS for performance and otherwise outgrown the capability of the largest available mainframes.

## Myth: Intel-based servers are not as powerful as mainframes 

In reality, new core-dense, Intel-based systems have as much compute capacity as mainframes.

## Myth: The cloud cannot accommodate mission-critical applications at places like large financial institutions. 

Although there may be isolated instances where cloud solutions fall short—some algorithms cannot be distributed, for example—these are the exceptions rather than the rule.

## Summary

By comparison, Azure offers an alternative platform capable of delivering equivalent mainframe functionality and features at much less cost. In addition, the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the cloud’s subscription-based, usage-driven cost model is simply far less expensive.
