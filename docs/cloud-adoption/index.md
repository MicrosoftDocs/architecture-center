# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The Cloud Adoption Framework is the One Microsoft approach to cloud adoption in Azure, consolidating and sharing best practices from Microsoft employees, partners, and customers. The framework gives enterprise customers a set of tools, guidance, and narratives that help shape technology, business, and people strategies for driving desired business outcomes during their adoption effort. This guidance aligns to various stages and iterations of the typical cloud adoption lifecycle, ensuring easy access to the right guidance at the right time.

## Getting started: Executive summaries

For customers who are new to the Cloud Adoption Framework, we offer three introductory articles: [Migrate](./getting-started/migrate.md), [Innovate](./getting-started/innovate.md), and [Enable](./getting-started/enable.md). Each article provides an executive summary and a high-level journey through an enterprise's adoption lifecycle.

For more specific guidance, continue reading for links to each stage of the adoption lifecycle.

## Use the Cloud Adoption Framework throughout the adoption lifecycle

Each section of the Cloud Adoption Framework maps to the overview diagram above. This list will help you align to the section that best matches your current stage in the cloud adoption lifecycle.

## Product roadmap

The Cloud Adoption Framework is currently offered as a public preview. The framework will reach general availability (GA) when the aspirational intent described in the next section has been met in full. In this preview release, the primary areas of focus are:

- [Cloud adoption strategy](./business-strategy/index.md)
- [Cloud adoption planning](./plan/index.md)
- [Cloud migration](./migrate/index.md)
- [Cloud governance](./governance/journeys/index.md)

We'll expand the Cloud Adoption Framework frequently as it moves closer to the GA release. The expansion will add depth to each section as well as new sections of content. For more information, see the [Cloud Adoption Framework roadmap](./appendix/roadmap.md).

## Intent

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure and use technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership of and responsibility for all aspects of technology, from infrastructure to software. By moving to the cloud, enterprises can provision and consume resources only when they're needed. Although the cloud offers tremendous flexibility in design choices, enterprises need a proven and consistent methodology for adopting cloud technologies. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure meets that need, helping guide decisions throughout cloud adoption.

However, cloud adoption is only a means to an end. Successful cloud adoption starts well before a cloud platform vendor is selected. It begins when business and IT decision makers realize that the cloud can accelerate a specific business transformation objective. The Cloud Adoption Framework can help them align strategies for business, culture, and technical change to achieve their desired business outcomes.

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides technical guidance for Microsoft Azure. Because enterprise customers might still be in the process of choosing a cloud vendor, the framework provides cloud-agnostic guidance for strategic decisions whenever possible.

## Intended audience

This guidance affects the business, technology, and culture of enterprises. The affected roles include line-of-business leaders, business decision makers, IT decision makers, finance, enterprise administrators, IT operations, IT security and compliance, IT governance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners. Each role uses its own vocabulary, and each has different objectives and key performance indicators. A single set of content can't address all audiences effectively.

Enter the **Cloud Architect**. The Cloud Architect serves as the thought leader and facilitator to bring these audiences together. We've designed this collection of guides to help Cloud Architects facilitate the right conversations with the right audiences and drive decision-making. Business transformation that's empowered by the cloud depends on the Cloud Architect role to help guide decisions throughout the business and IT.

Each section of the Cloud Adoption Framework represents a different specialization or variant of the Cloud Architect role. These sections also create opportunities to share cloud architecture responsibilities across a team of Cloud Architects. For example, the governance section is designed for Cloud Architects who have a passion for mitigating technical risks. Some cloud providers refer to these specialists as cloud custodians; we prefer the term _cloud guardian_ or, collectively, the _cloud governance team_.

## How to use the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

If your enterprise is new to Azure, begin by reading [Get started with the Cloud Adoption Framework](./getting-started/index.md). This overview provides prescriptive guidance for your enterprise's digital transformation as it walks you through each step of the process.

If your enterprise has experience with Azure and you're seeking more detailed guidance or best practices for specific areas, review the [governance overview](./governance/index.md) and the [architectural decision guides](./decision-guides/index.md). We'll add more sections as the GA release approaches.
