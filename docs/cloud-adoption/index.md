# Cloud Adoption Guide

The cloud presents a fundamental shift in the way that enterprises procure and utilize technology resources. In the past, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all levels of technology from infrastructure to software. Now, the cloud offers the potential to transform the way enterprises utilize technology by provisioning and consuming resources as needed.

While the cloud offers nearly unlimited flexibility in terms of design choices, enterprises seek proven and consistent methodology for the adoption of cloud technologies. And, each enterprise has different goals and timelines for cloud adoption, making a one-size-fits-all approach to adoption nearly impossible.

The process of adopting cloud technologies is not a linear process, and this is especially true for large enterprises with many different teams. Some teams may be responsible for a large set of existing workloads and have a requirement to modernize them by adding cloud technologies or migrating them completely. Other teams may have the opportunity to innovate by beginning new development from scratch in the cloud. Yet other teams may not be ready to adopt cloud technologies in production but are ready to learn about and experiment with the cloud.

Each of these different teams requires different approaches to adopting the cloud, but the core knowledge necessary to begin the process is common to all. For this reason, this guide approaches enterprise cloud adoption from the perspective of organizational readiness. The stages of organizational readiness are:

1. **Foundational Azure adopters:** for enterprises with little to no experience with Azure. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of deploying a basic Azure Web Site or a virtual network and an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machine.  
2. **Intermediate Azure adopters:** for enterprises with foundational experience in Azure. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of tracking costs and usage across multiple business units, connecting an on-premises network to an Azure virtual network, deploying single region n-tier workloads, and extending their security boundary to include Azure.
3. **Advanced Azure adopters:** for enterprises with intermediate experience in Azure. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of managing multiple devops environments, implementing complex hybrid networking scenarios for increased security, making workloads highly available to multiple regions around the globe. 
4. **Modernizing on-premises applications:** for enterprises with intermediate to advanced experience in Azure who want to integrate Azure technologies with on-premises work loads. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of enumerating and stack-ranking on-premises workloads for migration, performing the migration, and integrating migrated workloads into on-premises IT management and monitoring processes.
5. **Optimizing migrated applications for the cloud:** for enterprises at the modernizing stage who want to efficiently use cloud resources. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of evaluating Azure usage to identify unused or underutilized resources, scaling workloads, and scheduling workloads with instance reservation.
6. **Innovating in the cloud:** for enterprises with intermediate to advanced experience in Azure who want to develop native cloud applications from scratch. At the end of this stage, an enterprise is capable of developing and deploying resilient, highly available workloads that use native cloud services, microservices, and other cutting edge Azure services.

## How to use the Azure Cloud Adoption Guide

The Azure Cloud Adoption Guide is organized into a series of stages. Each stage includes a list of articles. The articles fall into one of three categories: articles that **explain** how something works, articles that describe **how to** accomplish a specific task, or articles that provide **guidance** to assist you in making technology choices and design decisions. 

The explainer articles provide background knowledge that makes it easier to understand how to accomplish a specific task. Some of the articles include a short explainer video that you can watch instead of reading the articles. As you work through the list of articles, when you reach a 'how to' document, follow the steps to accomplish the task before proceeding. The guidance articles provide best practice recommendations for the task. 

The articles are listed in order, and they are progressive. If you are already familiar with the subject matter in a article, you can move on to the next article in the list. 

## Audience

The audience for the Azure Cloud Adoption Guide includes Enterprise Administrators, Finance, IT operations, IT security and compliance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners.
