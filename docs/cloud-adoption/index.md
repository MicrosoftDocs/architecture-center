# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The cloud fundamentally changes how enterprises procure and use technology resources. Traditionally, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all aspects of technology from infrastructure to software. The cloud allows enterprises provisioning and consuming resources only when needed. While the cloud offers tremendous flexibility in design choices, enterprises need a proven and consistent methodology for the adopting cloud technologies. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure meets that need, helping guide decisions throughout cloud adoption.

However, cloud adoption is a means to an end. Successful cloud adoption starts well before a cloud platform vendor is selected. It begins when business and IT decision makers realize that the cloud can accelerate a specific business transformation objective. The Cloud Adoption Framework aids in aligning strategies for business, culture, and technical change to achieve the desired business outcomes.

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides technical guidance for Microsoft Azure. Recognizing that customers may still be in the process of choosing a cloud vendor, this framework provides cloud-agnostic guidance for higher-level decisions whenever possible.

## Product Truths

The Cloud Adoption Framework is currently offered as a Public Preview. The framework will reach general availability (GA) when the aspirational goals above are met. This preview release of the Cloud Adoption Framework focuses primarily on [Cloud Governance](./governance/journeys/overview.md) and [Cloud Migration](./migrate/overview.md). The Cloud Adoption Framework will be expanded frequently as it moves closer to GA release.

## Audience

The content in the Cloud Adoption Framework affects the business, technology, and culture of enterprises. The roles affected include line-of-business leaders, business decision makers, IT decision makers, finance, enterprise administrators, IT operations, IT security and compliance, IT governance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners. Each role uses different jargon. They each have different objectives and key performance indicators. A single set of content cannot address each of these audiences effectively.

### Enter the Cloud Architect

The Cloud Architect serves as the thought leader and facilitator to bring these audiences together. The content in this collection of guides is designed to help the Cloud Architect facilitate the right conversations with the right audiences to drive required decisions. Business transformation empowered by the cloud is dependent upon the Cloud Architect role to help guide decisions throughout the business and IT.

Each section of the Cloud Adoption Framework represents a different specialization or variant of the Cloud Architect role. These sections also create opportunities to share the cloud architecture responsibilities across a team of cloud architects. For example, the governance section of the Cloud Adoption Framework is designed for cloud architects with a passion for mitigating technical risks. Some cloud providers refer to these specialists as Cloud Custodians; we prefer the term Cloud Guardian or, collectively, the Cloud Governance team.

## How to use the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

If your enterprise is new to Azure, begin by reading [Getting started with the Cloud Adoption Framework](./getting-started/index.md). This overview provides prescriptive guidance for your enterprise's digital transformation, walking you through each step of the process.

If your enterprise has experience with Azure and is seeking more detailed guidance and best practices for specific areas, review the  [Governance overview](./governance/overview.md) and the [Architectural decision guides](./decision-guides/overview.md). More sections will be added as the GA release approaches.
