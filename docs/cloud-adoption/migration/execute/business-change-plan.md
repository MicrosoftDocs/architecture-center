# Fusion: Why do we need a Business Change Plan

The [Migration section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a DataCenter to the cloud. This article, expands on the [Migration Execution Process](overview.md) by reviewing activities associated with the creation and execution of a Business Change Plan for a release.
  
Traditionally Information Technology (IT) has overseen the release of new applications or workloads. During a major transformation like a DataCenter migration, or a Cloud Migration, a similar pattern of IT lead adoption could been applied as well. However, the traditional approach could miss opportunities to realize additional business value. For this reason, a broader approach to user adoption is suggested. This article will outline the ways in which a Business Change Plan adds to a standard User Adoption Plan.

## Traditional User Adoption Approach

User Adoption Plans focus on how users will adopt a new technology or change to a given technology. This approach is time-tested for introducing users to new tools. In a typical user adoption plan, information technology (IT) focuses on the install, configuration, maintenance, and training associated with the technical changes being introduced to the business environment.

While approaches may vary, general themes are present in most user adoption plans. These themes are generally based on a risk control and facilitation approach that aligns to evolutionary change. The Eason Matrix, pictured below, represents the drivers behind those themes across a spectrum of adoption types.

These themes are often based on the assumption that introduction of new solutions to users should focus largely on risk control and facilitation of change. Additionally, IT has focused mostly on risk from the technology change and facilitation of the technology change.

## Creating Business Change Plans

A Business Change Plan looks beyond the technical change and assumes that every release in a migration effort will drive some level of business process change. A Business Change Plan looks upstream and downstream from the technical changes. The following questions help participants think about user adoption from a business change perspective to maximize business impact.

**Upstream questions:** Upstream questions look at impacts or changes that come before user adoption happens.

* Has the an expected [business outcome](../../business-strategy/business-outcomes/overview.md) been quantified?
* Does the business impact map to defined [learning metrics](../../business-strategy/learning-metrics.md)?
* What business processes and teams leverage this technical solution?
* Who on the business can best align Power Users for testing and feedback?
* Have the impacted business leaders been involved in the prioritization and migration planning?
* Are there any critical events/dates for the business that could be impacted by this change?
* Does the business change plan maximize impact, but minimize business disruption?
* Is downtime expected? Has a downtime window been communicated to end users?

**Downstream questions:** Once the adoption is compete, the business change can begin. Unfortunately, this is where many user adoption plans end. Downstream questions help the Cloud Strategy Team maintain a focus on transformation after technical change is completed.

* Are business users responding well to the changes? 
* Have performance anticipation been maintained, now that the technical change has been adopted?
* Are business processes or customer experiences changing in the anticipated ways?
* Are additional changes required to realize learning metrics?
* Did the changes align to the targeted business outcomes? If not, why?
* Are additional changes required to contribute to business outcomes?
* Have any negative impacts been observed as a result of this change?

The Business Change Plan will vary from company to company. The goal of these questions is to help better integrate the business into the change associated with each release. By looking at each release not as a technology change to be adopted, but instead as a business change plan, business outcomes can become more obtainable.
