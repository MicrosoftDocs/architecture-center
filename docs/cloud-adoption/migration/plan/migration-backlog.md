# Fusion: What is a migration backlog or cloud adoption backlog?

The article on [Incremental Rationalization](../../digital-estate/rationalize-inventory.md) discusses the creation of the first migration backlog or cloud adoption backlog. This article will discuss the evolution and pruning of that backlog for the purposes of change management and overall transformation management. In this article and others in the Fusion Framework, it is assumed that a migration backlog and cloud adoption backlog are equivalent terms for the same asset.

When the Cloud Strategy Team and Cloud Adoption Team develop the first migration backlog, it is likely limited to 10 applications or workloads withing a much broader [digital estate](../../digital-estate/overview.md).

## Parallel Evolution

If the Cloud Strategy Team is dedicating 10-20 hours per week in initial phases, the migration backlog will quickly fill in details required to guide the full transformation. If this team is less dedicated, the backlog will take longer to evolve. In general, it requires much less time to perform quantitative analysis and initial decisioning than it does to adopt new technologies. As such, the backlog should grow in parallel to, but faster than it can be depleted by migration/adoption efforts.

## Pruning & prioritization

As the market changes and evolves, so will the highest priority backlog for the overall migration/adoption effort. As the backlog matures, the role of the Cloud Strategy Team will also mature. Overtime, the Cloud Strategy Team will find themselves making granular decisions regarding the priority of the next 10 workloads. Each release business demands will prompt changes to the Power of Ten list. At the end of any iteration, the Cloud Adoption Team will take a dependency on the Cloud Strategy Team. That dependency is well defined: At the end of any iteration of effort the team should be able to look to the migration backlog for a consensus on the list of the 10 highest priority workloads to migration/adopt. If the Cloud Strategy Team ever fails to maintain that top 10 list in alignment with business needs, it is time to consider a rotation of members on the team.

## Validation and Subject Matter Expertise

At any time, the Cloud Adoption Team should be able to turn to the Cloud Strategy Team for guidance on the top 10 list of applications/workloads to be migrated. When the team can't answer questions directly, they are expected to provide and facilitate access to members of the impacted business unit who can provide answers. If the top 10 list is populated with applications outside of the members area of expertise, the Cloud Strategy Team is expected to cultivate the required relationships or rotate members to ensure proper alignment.

## Power of 10 Test

As this article illustrates, the Cloud Strategy Team should be comprised of leaders approved by the CEO and CIO that can accurately and efficiently make business decisions that at minimum will impact the next 10 workloads in the migration/adoption backlog. Preferably, the Cloud Strategy Team will be comprised of sufficient executive support to make unilateral decisions regarding the business transformation. However, at minimum, the Cloud Strategy Team must be able to make decisions regarding the current release of the technical strategy (I.E. the next 10 workloads to be released.)

## Next Step

With an accurate, pruned, and well-supported Migration Backlog, the team is ready to begin [migration execution](../execute/overview.md).
