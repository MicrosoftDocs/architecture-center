# Cloud operation capabilities

Business transformation may be enabled by cloud adoption. However, returns are only realized when the workloads deployed to the cloud are operating in alignment with performance expectations. As additional workloads adopt cloud technologies, additional operations capacity will be required.

Traditional IT operations were required to focus on maintaining current-state operations for a wide variety of low-level technical assets. Things like storage, cpu, memory, network equipment, servers, and virtual machine hosts require continuous maintenance to maintain peek operations. Capital budgets often include large expenses related to annual or periodic updates to these low-level assets.

 Human capital within operations would also focus heavily on the monitoring, repair, and remediation of issues related to these assets. In the cloud, many of these capital costs and operations activities are transferred to the cloud provider. This provides an opportunity for IT operations to improve and provide significant additional value.

## Possible sources for this capability

The skills needed to provide cloud operations capabilities could be provided by:

- IT operations
- Outsource IT operations vendors
- Cloud service providers
- Cloud-managed service providers
- Application-specific operations teams
- Business application operations teams
- DevOps teams

## Key responsibilities

The duties of the people providing cloud operations capability is to deliver maximum workload performance and minimum business interruptions within agreed upon operations budgets.

### Strategic tasks

- Review [business outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/index.md), [financial models](../business-strategy/financial-models.md), [motivations for cloud adoption](../business-strategy/motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md), [business risks](../governance/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md), and [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md).
- Determine workload criticality, impact of disruptions or performance degradation.
- Establish business approved cost/performance commitments.
- Monitor and operate cloud workloads.

### Technical tasks

- Maintain asset and workload inventory.
- Monitor performance of workloads.
- Maintain operational compliance.
- Protect workloads and associated assets.
- Recover assets in the case of performance degradation or business interruption.
- Mature capabilities of core platforms.
- Continuously improve workload performance.
- Improve budgetary and design requirements of workloads to fit commitments to the business.

## Meeting cadence

Those performing cloud operations capabilities should be involved in release planning and cloud center of excellence planning to provide feedback and prepare for operational requirements.

## Next steps

As adoption and operations scale, it's important to define and automate governance best practices that extend existing IT requirements. Forming a [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md) is an important step to scaling cloud adoption, cloud operations, and cloud governance efforts.
