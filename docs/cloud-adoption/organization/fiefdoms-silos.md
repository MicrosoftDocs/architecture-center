# Organizational antipatterns: Fiefdoms and silos

Success in any major change to business practices, culture, or technology operations requires a growth mindset. At the heart of the growth mindset is an acceptance of change and the ability to lead in spite of ambiguity. Some antipatterns can block a growth mindset in organizations seeking to grow and transform, including micromanagement, biased thinking, and exclusionary practices. Many of these blockers are personal challenges that create personal growth opportunities for everyone. However, there are two antipatterns commonly seen in IT that require more than individual growth or maturity: fiefdoms and silos.

![Comparing healthy teams and organizational antipatterns](../_images/ready/fiefdom-and-silo.png)
*Figure 1: Comparison of healthy teams and the organizational antipatterns*

These antipatterns are a result of organic changes within various teams, which result in unhealthy organizational behaviors. To properly address the resistance caused by each antipattern, it's important to understand the root cause of this formation as compared to the proper pattern of healthy, organic IT teams.

## Healthy, organic IT teams

It is entirely natural to create a division of labor across IT. It's healthy to establish groups or teams that have similar expertise, shared processes, a common objective, and aligned vision. It is also natural for those teams to have their own micro-culture, shared norms, and perspectives.

Healthy IT teams focus on partnering with other teams to promote the successful completion of their assigned duties. Healthy IT teams seek to understand the business goals their technology contribution is designed to support. The details and fiscal impact may be fuzzy, but the team's value contribution is often understood within the team. While healthy IT teams have a passion for the technology they support, they are open to change and willing to try new things. Such teams are often the earliest and strongest contributors to cloud center of excellence efforts. Their contribution should be heavily encouraged.

### Natural resistance to change

At times, the micro-cultures within healthy IT teams may react poorly to executive or top-down decisions to drive change. This reaction is natural, as collectives of human beings with shared norms naturally cooperate to overcome external threats. Changes that impact the team's day-to-day jobs, sense of security, or autonomy can be viewed as a risk to the collective. Signs of resistance are often an early indicator that the team doesn't feel like they are part of the decision-making process. When cloud architects and other leaders invest in abolishing personal biases and driving for inclusion of the existing IT teams, this resistance is likely to lessen quickly and dissolve over time. One tool available to cloud architects and leaders to create inclusive decision making is the formation of a [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md).

### Healthy friction

It is easy to confusion resistance with friction. Existing IT teams can be knowledgeable regarding past mistakes, tangible risks, tribal knowledge about solutions, and undocumented technical debt. Unfortunately, even the healthiest of IT teams can fall in the trap of describing these important data points as part of a specific technical solution, which shouldn't be changed. This approach to communication masks the teams' knowledge, creating a perception of resistance. Providing these teams with a mechanism for properly communicating in future looking terminology will add data points, identify gaps, and create healthy friction around the proposed solutions. That extra friction will sand down rough edges on the solution & drive longer-term values. Simply changing the conversation can create clarity around complex topics, generate energy to collaborate on a better solution, and deliver more successful solutions.

The guidance on [defining corporate policy](../governance/corporate-policy.md) is aimed at facilitating risk-based conversations with business stakeholders. However, this same model can be used to facilitate conversations with teams that are perceived as cloud-resistent. When the perception of resistance is wide-spread, it could be wise to include resistance resolution practices in the charter for a [cloud governance team](./cloud-governance.md).

## Antipatterns

The organic and responsive growth within IT that creates healthy IT teams can also result in antipatterns that frequently block transformation and cloud adoption. IT fiefdoms and IT silos are different than the natural microcultures within healthy IT teams. In either pattern, the team focus tends to be directed at defensive protection of their "turf". When confronted with an opportunity to drive change and improve operations, members of these antipatterns will invest more time and energy into blocking the change than finding a positive solution.

As mentioned above, healthy IT teams can create natural resistance and healthy friction. Fiefdoms and silos are a bit of a different challenge. Sadly, there is no documented leading indicator for either antipattern. These antipatterns tend to be identified after months of [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md) and [cloud governance team](./cloud-governance.md) efforts. They are discovered as the result of continued, ongoing resistance. Even in toxic cultures, the efforts of the CCoE and cloud governance team should be able to drive cultural growth and technical progress. After months of effort, there may still be a few teams that show no signs of inclusive behaviors and still stand firm in their resistance to change. These teams are likely operating in one of the following antipattern models. While the following have similar symptoms, the root cause and approaches to addressing resistance is radically different between the two.

## IT silos

Team members within an IT Silo are likely to define themselves through their alignment to a small number of IT vendors or an area of technical specialization. However, don't confuse IT silos with IT fiefdoms. IT silos tend to be comfort- and passion-driven, and are generally easier to overcome than the fear-driven motives behind fiefdoms. This antipattern often emerges as a result of a common passion for a specific solution. IT silos are then reinforced by the team's advanced skills as a result of the investment in that specific solution. This superior skill can be an accelerator to cloud adoption efforts if the resistance to change can be overcome. It can also become a major blocker if the silos are broken down or if the team members can't accurately evaluate options. Fortunately, IT silos can often be overcome without any significant changes to the organizational chart.

## Addressing resistance from IT Silos

IT silos can be addressed through several approaches. The appropriate approach will depend on the root cause of the resistance. The following are a few tools to aid in combating this form of resistance.

**V-team creation:** The [introduction to the organizational readiness](./index.md) section of the Cloud Adoption Framework introduces a multilayered structure for properly integrating and defining four virtual teams (or V-Teams). Creation of this team structure provides many benefits. One of the benefits of this structure is the introduction of cross-organization visibility and inclusion. Introducing a [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md) creates a high-profile aspirational team that top engineers will want to participate in. This helps create new cross-solution alignments that aren't bound by organizational-chart constraints, and will inherently drive inclusion of top engineers who have been sheltered by IT silos. Introduction of a [Cloud Strategy Team](./cloud-strategy.md) will create immediate visibility to IT contributions regarding cloud adoption efforts. When IT silos fight for separation, this visibility can help motivate IT and business leaders to properly support those resistant team members. This process is a quick path to stakeholder engagement and support.

**Experimentation and Exposure:** Team members in an IT silo have likely been constrained to think a certain way for some time. Breaking the one-track mind is a first step to addressing resistance. Experimentation and exposure are powerful tools for breaking down barriers in silos. The team may be resistant to competing solutions, so it's not wise to put them in charge of an experiment that competes with their existing solution. However, as part of a first workload test of the cloud, competing solutions should be implemented. The siloed team should be invited to participate as an input and review source, but not as a decision maker. This should be clearly communicated to the team along with a commitment to engage them more deeply as a decision maker before moving into production solutions. During review of the competing solution, use the practices outlined in [defining corporate policy](../governance/corporate-policy.md) to document tangible risks of the experiment and establish policies that help the siloed team become more comfortable with the future state. This will expose the team to new solutions and harden the future solution.

**Be "boundary-less":** The teams driving cloud adoption find it easy to push boundaries by exploring exciting, new cloud-native solutions. This is one half of the approach to removing boundaries. However, that thinking can further reinforce IT silos. Pushing for change too quickly and without respect to existing cultures can create unhealthy friction and lead to natural resistance. When IT silos start to resist, it's important to be boundary-less in your own solutions. Be mindful of one simple truth: cloud-native isn't always the best solution. Consider hybrid solutions that may provide an opportunity to extend the existing investments of the IT silo into the future. Also consider cloud-based versions of the solution used by the IT silo team today. Experiment with those solutions and expose yourself to the viewpoint of those living in the IT silo. At minimum, you will gain a fresh perspective. In many situations, you may earn enough of the IT silo's respect that the walls naturally fall down.

**Invest in education:** Many people living within an IT silo became passionate about the current solution as a result of expanding their own education. Investing in the education of these teams is seldom misplaced. Allocate time for these individuals to engage in self-learning, classes, or even conferences to break the day-to-day focus on the current solution. However, to be an investment, some return must come as a result of the expense. In exchange for the investment, the team could provide a demo of the proposed solution to the rest of the teams involved in cloud adoption. They could also provide documentation of the tangible risks, risk management approaches, and desired policies if adopting the proposed solution. Each will engage these teams in the solution and transfer some of their tribal knowledge into the future solution.

**Road bumps vs road blocks:** IT silos can slow or stop any transformation. Experimentation and iteration will find a way but only if the project keeps moving. Focus on turning roadblocks into road bumps. Define policies that everyone can be temporarily comfortable with in exchange for continued progression.

For instance, if IT security is the roadblock because their security solution can't monitor compromises of protected data in the cloud, establish data classification policies. Prevent deployment of classified data into the cloud until an agreeable solution can be found. Invite IT security into experimentation with hybrid or cloud native solutions to monitor protected data. If Networking operates as a silo, identify workloads that are self-contained and don't have network dependencies. In parallel, experiment, expose, and educate the networking team while working on hybrid or alternative solutions.

**Be patient and be inclusive:** It's tempting to move on without support of an IT silo. However, this decision will cause disruptions and roadblocks down the road. Be patient with members of the IT silo, as changing minds can take time. Be patient of their natural resistance--convert it to value. Be inclusive and invite in healthy friction to improve the end solution.

**Never compete:** The IT silo exists for a reason. It persists for a reason. There is an investment in maintaining the solution they are passionate about for a reason. Directly competing with the solution or the IT silo will distract from the real goal of achieving business outcomes. This trap has road blocked a great deal of transformation projects. Stay focused on the end goal as opposed to a single component of the end goal. Help accentuate the positive aspects of the IT silo's solution & help them make wise decisions about the best solutions for the future. That never involves insulting or degrading the solution that is in place today. Such resistance would be futile.

**Partner with the business:** If the business outcomes are not blocked by the IT silo, why do you care? There is no silver bullet. There is no perfect solution or perfect IT vendor. Competition exists for a reason; each has its own benefits. Embrace diversity and include the business by supporting and aligning to a strong [cloud strategy team](./cloud-strategy.md). When an IT silo supports a solution that blocks business outcomes, it will be easier to communicate that roadblock without the noise of technical squabbles. Supporting nonblocking IT silos will show an ability to partner for the desired business outcomes. Together, these will earn more respect and greater support from the business when an IT silo presents a legitimate blocker.

If the following approaches yield no change, you may be facing an IT fiefdom. After trying all of the guidance in this article with no success, the following information may be of value.

## IT fiefdoms

Team members within an IT fiefdom are likely to define themselves through their alignment to a specific process or area of responsibility. The team operates under a general assumption that external influence on their area of responsibility will lead to problems. Fiefdoms tend to be a fear-driven antipattern, which will require significant leadership support to overcome. Fiefdoms are especially common in organizations that have experienced IT downsizing, frequent turbulence in IT staff, or have seen poor IT leadership. When IT is seen purely as a cost center by the business fiefdoms, are much more likely to arise.

Generally fiefdoms are the result of a line manager who fears loss of the team and the associated power base. These leaders often have a sense of duty to their team & feel a need to protect their subordinates from negative consequences. These managers will commonly use phrases like "shelter the team from change" and "protect the team from process disruption". Both are natural and solid phrases but can be indicators of an overly guarded leader that may require some additional support from leadership.

### Addressing resistance from IT fiefdoms

IT fiefdoms can demonstrate some growth by following the approaches to [addressing IT silo resistance above](#addressing-resistance-from-it-silos). Before attempting to address resistance from an IT fiefdom, it's advised that you treat the team like an IT silo first. When those types of approaches fail to yield any significant change, the resistant team may be suffering from an IT fiefdom antipattern. The root cause of IT fiefdoms is a little more complex to address, as that resistance tends to come from the direct line manager (or a leader higher up the organization chart). For your sake, lets hope the challenges are simply IT silo-driven.

Managers within IT fiefdoms tend to be amongst the strongest, high potential managers in any organization. Their ability to inspire and build confidence in teams is often unmatched. As is their ability to block growth, transformation, and business success. Unfortunately, the passion and intelligence of these managers can turn toxic, and a fear-driven or protection-driven micro-culture emerges. Sadly, these managers are likely to continue to be a blocker without changes to the org chart. When continued resistance from IT fiefdoms block cloud adoption efforts, it could be wise for a combined effort to evaluate the situation with existing IT leaders. Insights from the [cloud strategy team](./cloud-strategy.md), [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md), and [cloud governance team](./cloud-governance.md) should be considered carefully by IT leadership before making decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> Note for IT leaders: change to the org chart should never be taken lightly. Further, feedback from each of the supporting teams should be validated and analyzed. However, it's important to understand that transformative efforts like cloud adoption tend to magnify underlying issues that have likely gone unnoticed or unaddressed long before this effort. When fiefdoms are preventing the company's success, leadership changes are a likely necessity. Fortunately, removing the leader of a fiefdom doesn't often end in termination. These strong, passionate leaders can often move into a management role after a brief period of reflection. With the right support from you, this change could be healthy for the leader of the fiefdom and the current team.
> [!CAUTION]
> Cautionary note to managers of IT fiefdoms. Protecting the team from risk is a clear leadership value. However, there is a fine line between protection and isolation. When the team is blocked from participating in driving changes, it can have psychological and professional consequences on the team. The urge to resist change may be strong, especially during times of visible change. As the manager of any isolated team, you can best demonstrate a growth mindset (and grow as a manager) by experimenting with the guidance associated with healthy IT teams in the sections above. Active and optimistic participation in governance and center of excellence activities can be a great source for personal growth if you can do so with an open mind. You are best positioned to change stifling mindsets. Leading such change is often rewarded with ideas and team growth beyond what you could imagine.

IT fiefdoms can be a sign of broader systemic leadership issues. To overcome an IT fiefdom, IT leaders will need the ability to make changes to operations, responsibilities, and occasionally even the people providing line management of specific teams. When those changes are required, it's wise to approach those changes with clear & defensible data points. Alignment with business stakeholders, business motivations, and business outcomes may be required to drive the necessary change. Partnership with the [cloud strategy team](./cloud-strategy.md), [cloud center of excellence](./cloud-center-excellence.md), and [cloud governance team](./cloud-governance.md) can provide the data points needed for a defensible position. When necessary, these teams should be involved in a group escalation to address challenges that can't be addressed with IT leadership alone.

## Next steps

Disrupting organizational antipatterns is a team effort. To begin acting on this guidance, review the [organizational readiness introduction](./index.md) for help with identifying the right team structures and participants.
