# Cloud strategy capabilities

Successful cloud adoption should align to defined motivations and business outcomes. When those outcomes impact business functions, it's a good idea to establish a team made up of business leaders from across the organization. To unite various leaders, we recommend that the executive leadership create a cloud strategy team. The goal of the cloud strategy team is to produce tangible business results that are enabled by cloud technologies. This team ensures that cloud adoption efforts progress in alignment with business outcomes.

In the absence of a defined cloud strategy team, someone must still provide the capability to align technical activities to business outcomes. That same person or group should also manage change across the project. This section defines this capability in more detail.

## Possible sources for this capability

This capability is commonly provided by the following types of roles. When a cloud strategy team is defined, it should include many of the following roles:

- Finance
- Line of business
- Human resources
- Operations
- Enterprise architecture
- IT infrastructure
- Application groups
- Project managers (Often with Agile project management experience)

This capability helps guide critical prioritization and discovery efforts during cloud adoption. It may also trigger changes in business processes, the execution of operations, customer interactions, or even product development. If this capability is confined to IT, the success of cloud adoption efforts will be constrained. To drive true business change, business leaders should be the primary source of this capability. A defined cloud strategy team provides a means for involving key participants in a structured way.

> [!NOTE]
> The organization's CEO and CIO often assign the team. Assignments are typically based on empowering this team to drive change that cuts across various different organizations within the enterprise. The cloud strategy team members should be assigned based on the [motivations for cloud adoption](../business-strategy/motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md), [business outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/index.md), and relevant [financial models](../business-strategy/financial-models.md).

## Key responsibilities

The primary focus of the cloud strategy is to validate and maintain alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts. Secondarily, you should focus on change management across the adoption efforts. The following tasks assist in achieving this capability.

### Early planning tasks

- Review and provide feedback on [business outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/index.md) and [financial models](../business-strategy/financial-models.md).
- Aid in establishing clear [motivations for cloud adoption](../business-strategy/motivations-why-are-we-moving-to-the-cloud.md) that align with corporate objectives.
- Define relevant [learning metrics](../business-strategy/learning-metrics.md) that clearly communicate progress toward business outcomes.
- Understand [business risks](../governance/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md) introduced by the plan, represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../governance/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md).
- Review and approve the [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/rationalize.md).

### Ongoing monthly tasks

- Support the [cloud governance capability](./cloud-governance.md) during risk/tolerance conversations.
- Review release plans to understand timelines and business impact of technical change.
- Define business change plans associated with planned releases.
- Ensure business teams are ready to execute business testing and the business change plan.

## Meeting cadence

The tasks listed in preceding section can be time-consuming in the early planning phases. Here are some recommendations for the allocation of time for cloud strategy team members:

- During early planning efforts, allocate an hour each week to meet with the team. After the adoption plan is solidified (usually within 4&ndash;6 weeks), the time requirements can be reduced.
- Throughout the adoption efforts, allocate 1&ndash;2 hours each month to review progress and validate continued priorities.
- Additional time is likely required from delegated members of the executive's team on an as-needed basis. Each member of the cloud strategy team should appoint a delegate who can allocate 5&ndash;10 hours per week to support ongoing prioritization questions and report on any urgent needs.

## Next steps

Strategy and planning are important. However, nothing is actionable without [cloud adoption capabilities](./cloud-adoption.md). Understand the role of this important capability before beginning adoption efforts.
