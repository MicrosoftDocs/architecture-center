# Resource Consistency template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The template below serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern IT operations and management in the cloud.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Resource Consistency policy statements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Resource Consistency discipline within your cloud governance strategy.

## Next steps

Solid governance practices start with an understanding of business risk. Review the article on business risks and begin to document the business risks that align with your current cloud adoption plan.
