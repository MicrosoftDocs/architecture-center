# Identity Baseline template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The template below serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern identity services in the cloud.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Identity Baseline policy statements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Identity Baseline discipline within your cloud governance strategy.

## Next steps

Solid governance practices start with an [understanding of business risk](./business-risks.md). Review the article on business risks and begin to document the business risks that align with your current cloud adoption plan.
