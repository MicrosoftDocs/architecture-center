# Identity Baseline tools in Azure

[Identity Baseline](overview.md) is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md). This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies that ensure consistency and continuity of user identities regardless of the cloud provider that hosts the application or workload.

The following tools are included in the discovery guide on Hybrid Identity.

**Active Directory (on-premises):** Active Directory is the identity provider most frequently used in the enterprise to store and validate user credentials.

**Azure Active Directory:** A software as a service (SaaS) equivalent to Active Directory, capable of federating with an on-premises Active Directory.

**Active Directory (IaaS):** An instance of the Active Directory application running in a virtual machine in Azure.

Identity is the control plane for IT security. So authentication is an organization’s access guard to the cloud. Organizations need an identity control plane that strengthens their security and keeps their cloud apps safe from intruders.

## Cloud authentication

Choosing the correct authentication method is the first concern for organizations wanting to move their apps to the cloud.

When you choose this method, Azure AD handles users' sign-in process. Coupled with seamless single sign-on (SSO), users can sign in to cloud apps without having to reenter their credentials. With cloud authentication, you can choose from two options:

**Azure AD password hash synchronization**: The simplest way to enable authentication for on-premises directory objects in Azure AD. This method can also be used with any method as a back-up failover authentication method in case your on-premises server goes down.

**Azure AD Pass-through Authentication**: Provides a persistent password validation for Azure AD authentication services by using a software agent that runs on one or more on-premises servers.

> [!NOTE]
> Companies with a security requirement to immediately enforce on-premises user account states, password policies, and sign-in hours should consider the pass-through Authentication method.

**Federated authentication:**

When you choose this method, Azure AD passes the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or a trusted third-party federation provider, to validate the user’s password.

The article [choosing the right authentication method for Azure Active Directory](/azure/security/azure-ad-choose-authn) contains a decision tree to help you choose the best solution for your organization.

The following table lists the native tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support this governance discipline.

## Next steps

The [Hybrid Identity Digital Transformation Framework](https://resources.office.com/ww-landing-M365E-EMS-IDAM-Hybrid-Identity-WhitePaper.html?LCID=EN-US) outlines a number of combinations and solutions for choosing and integrating each of these components.

The [Azure AD Connect tool](https://aka.ms/aadconnectwiz) helps you to integrate your on-premises directories with Azure AD.
