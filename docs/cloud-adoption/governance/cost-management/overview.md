# Fusion: How can a company add Cost Management discipline to their Cloud Governance execution?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Cost Management is defined as one of the five disciplines of Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing cloud spend plans, allocations of cloud budgets,  monitoring/enforcement of cloud budgets, detecting costly anomalies, and adjusting the plan when actual spending is misaligned.

This article outlines the Cost Management process that a company experiences during the planning, building, adopting, and operating phases of implementing a cloud solution. It's impossible for any one document to account for all of the requirements of any business. As such, each section of this article outlines suggested minimum and potential activities. The objective of these activities is to help you build a [Policy MVP](../policy-compliance/overview.md) and establish a framework for [Incremental Policy](../policy-compliance/overview.md) evolution. The Cloud Governance Team should decide how much to invest in these activities to improve the Cost Management position.

> [!CAUTION]
> Neither the minimum or potential activities outlined in this article are aligned to specific corporate policies or third party compliance requirements. This guidance is designed to help facilitate the conversations that will lead to alignment of both requirements with a Cloud Governance Model.

![Four phases of adoption](../../_images/adoption-phases.png)

*Figure 1. Adoption phases of the incremental approach to cloud governance*

## Planning and readiness

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Plan process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/plan.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Evaluate your [Cost Management tool Chain](toolchain.md) options.
* Develop a draft Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Educate and involve the people and teams impacted by the development of Architecture Guidelines.

**Potential activities**

* Ensure budgetary decisions that support the [Business Justification](../../business-strategy/cloud-migration-business-case.md) for your cloud strategy.
* Validate [learning metrics](../../business-strategy/learning-metrics.md) that you use to report on the successful allocation of funding.
* Understand the desired [Cloud Accounting Model](../../business-strategy/cloud-accounting.md) that impact how cloud costs should be accounted for.
* Become familiar with the [Digital Estate Plan](../../digital-estate/overview.md) and validate accurate costing expectations.
* Evaluate buying options to determine if it's better to "pay as you go" or to make a pre-committment by purchasing an Enterprise Agreement.
* Align business goals with planned budgets and adjust budgetary plans as necessary.
* Develop a goals and budget reporting mechanism to notify technical and business stakeholders at the end of each cost cycle.

## Build and pre-deployment

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Build process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/build.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Implement your [Cost Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) by rolling out in a pre-deployment phase.
* Update the Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Develop educational materials and documentation, awareness communications, incentives and other programs to help drive user adoption.
* Dertemine if your purchase requirements align with your budgets and goals. 

**Potential activities**

* Align your budgetary plans with the [Subscription Strategy](../../infrastructure/subscriptions/overview.md) that defines your core ownership model.
* Leverage the [Resource Grouping Strategy](../../infrastructure/resource-grouping/overview.md) to enforce architecture and cost guidelines over time.
* Determine if there are any cost anomolies that impact your adoption and migration plans.

## Adopt and migrate

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Migrate process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/migrate.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Migrate your [Cost Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) from pre-deployment to production.
* Update the Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Develop educational materials and documentation, awareness communications, incentives and other programs to help drive user adoption.

**Potential activities**

* Impelement your Cloud Accounting Model.
* Ensure that your budgets reflect your actual spending durring each release and adjust as necessary.
* Monitor changes in budgetary plans and validate with stakeholders if additional sign-offs are needed.
* Update changes to the Architecture Guidelines document to reflect actual costs.

## Operate and post-implementation

Once the transformation is complete, governance and operations must live on for the natural lifecycle of an  application or workload. This phase of governance maturity focuses on the activities that commonly come after the solution is implemented and the transformation cycle begins to stabilize.

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Customize [Cost Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) based on updates to your organization’s changing cost management needs.
* Consider automating any notifications and reports to reflect actual spending.
* Refine Architecture Guidelines to guide future adoption processes.
* Re-educate impacted teams on a periodic basis to ensure on-going adherence to the Architecture Guidelines.

**Potential activities**

* Execute a Quarterly Cloud Business Review to communicate value delivered to the business and associated costs.
* Adjust plans quarterly to reflect changes to actual spending.
* Determine financial alignment to P&Ls for business unit subcriptions.
* Analyze stakeholder value and cost reporting methods on a monthly basis.
* Remediate underused assets and determine if they're worth continuing. 
* Detect misalignments and anomalies between the plan and actual spending.
* Aid the Cloud Adoption Team and Cloud Strategy Team in understanding and resolving these anomalies.
