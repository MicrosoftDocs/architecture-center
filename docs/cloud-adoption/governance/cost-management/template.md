# Cost Management template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The template below serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern Cost Management in the cloud.

Although it contains example content related to the Cost Management discipline, this template can be used as the basis for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling used to define policy statements for any of the cloud governance disciplines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Cost Management discipline within your cloud governance strategy.

## Next steps

Solid governance practices start with an understanding of business risk. Review the article on business risks and begin to document the business risks that align with your current cloud adoption plan.
