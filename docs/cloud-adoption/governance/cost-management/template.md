# Cost Management template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The template below serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern Cost Management issues in the cloud.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Cost Management policy statements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Cost Management discipline within your cloud governance strategy.

## Next steps

Solid governance practices start with an understanding of business risk. Review the article on business risks and begin to document the business risks that align with your current cloud adoption plan.
