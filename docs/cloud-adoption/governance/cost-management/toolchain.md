# Fusion: What tools can help better manage costs in Azure?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), [Cost Management](overview.md) is one of the Five Disciplines to Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing cloud spend plans, allocations of cloud budgets,  monitoring/enforcement of cloud budgets, detecting costly anomalies, and adjusting the plan when actual spending is misaligned.

Unlike the cloud agnostic position throughout Fusion, this article is Azure specific. The following is a list of Azure native tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support this governance discipline.
