# Fusion: What tools can help better manage costs in Azure?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), [Cost Management](overview.md) is one of the five cloud governance disciplines. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing cloud spend plans, allocating cloud budgets, monitoring/enforcement of cloud budgets, detecting costly anomalies, and adjusting the cloud governancne plan when actual spending is misaligned.

Unlike the cloud-agnostic position used throughout Fusion, this article is Azure specific. The following is a list of Azure native tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support this governance discipline.
