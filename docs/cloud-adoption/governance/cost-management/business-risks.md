# Fusion: Motivations and business risks that drive cost governance

This article discusses the reasons that customers typically adopt a cost management discipline within a cloud governance strategy. It also provides a few examples of business risks which drive policy statements.

## Is cost management relevant?

In terms of cost governance, cloud adoption creates a paradigm shift. Management of cost in a traditional on-premises world is based on refresh cycles, data center acquisitions, host renewals, and recurring maintenance issues. You can forecast, plan, and refine each of these costs to align with annual capital expenditure budgets.

For cloud solutions, many businesses tend to take a more reactive approach to cost management. In many cases, businesses will pre-purchase, or commit to use, a set amount of cloud services. This model assumes that maximizing discounts, based on how much the business plans on spending with a specific cloud vendor, creates the perception of a proactive, planned cost cycle. However, that perception will only become a reality if the business also implements mature cost management disciplines.

The cloud offers self-service capabilities that were previously unheard of in traditional on-premises datacenters. These new capabilities empower businesses to be more agile, less restrictive, and more open to adopt new technologies. However, the downside of self-service is that end users can unknowingly exceed allocated budgets. Conversely, the same users can experience a change in plans and unexpectedly not use the amount of cloud services forecasted. The potential of shift in either direction prompts for a cost management discipline within the governance team. The remainder of this article discusses corporate policies and manual processes that can protect against misaligned cost forecasts.

## Business risk

The cost management discipline attempts to address the following business risks. During cloud adoption, monitor each of the following for relevance:

* Budget Control: Not controlling budget can lead to excessive spending with a cloud vendor
* Utilization Loss: Pre-purchases or pre-commits that are not used can result in wasted investments
* Spend Anomalies: Unexpected spikes in either direction can be indicators of improper usage
* Over provisioned Assets: When assets are deployed in a configuration that exceed the needs of an application or virtual maching (VM), they can increase costs and create waste.

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management Template](./template.md), document business risks that are likely to be introduced by the current cloud adoption plan.

Once an understanding of realistic business risks is established, the next step is to document the business's [tolerance for risk](./metrics-tolerance.md) and the indicators / key metrics to monitor that tolerance.
