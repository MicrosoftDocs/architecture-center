# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Governance overview

This section of Azure enterprise cloud adoption covers the topic of *governance*. If you are new to the topic of goverance in Azure, you can begin with [what is cloud resource governance?](../getting-started/what-is-governance.md) and [resource access management in Azure](../getting-started/azure-resource-access.md) in the [getting started](../getting-started/overview.md) section.

If you are familiar with the concept of governance, this section covers [governance design for a simple workload](governance-single-team.md) and [governance design for multiple teams and multiple workloads](governance-multiple-teams.md). Both of these documents include an implementation guide.

## Next steps

Once you have learned how to design and implment a governance model in Azure, you can move on to learn how to deploy an [infrastructure](../infrastructure/basic-workload.md) to Azure.
