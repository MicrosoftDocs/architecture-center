# Fusion: What is cloud governance?

In the Fusion framework, governance specifically focuses on actionable governance practices, including policies, enforcement, and management (cost, security, resource, identity, and configuration). Each of these facets is vital to ensure that cloud adoption is safely governed.

**Governance strategy** The cloud offers a variety of management tools. Tools are used to automate and define action-based policies. Healthy governance strategy starts with an [understanding of business risks](policy-compliance/understanding-business-risk.md). Then [policy](policy-compliance/overview.md) creates barriers to help mitigate those risks. Once policy is established, [monitoring and enforcement](monitoring-enforcement/overview.md) provides additional guidelines that define how policy is enforced and what happens when a deviation to policy occurs.

In some industry verticals, [regulatory compliance](policy-compliance/what-is-regulatory-compliance.md) supercedes corporate policy, and therefore requires a set of stricter guidelines. These enforceable yet flexible policies are the basis of any mature governance strategy. When policies accurately reflect tangible risks and the business' tolerance for risk, and not technical dogma, the policies and resulting strategy can be more easily adapted to align with the cloud or any other technical deployment.

**Governance execution** This framework focuses on the five disciplines of cloud governance, and each implements a different aspect of corporate policies to support safe cloud adoption. These disciplines include [cost management](cost-management/overview.md), [security management](security-management/overview.md), [identity management](identity-management/overview.md), [resource management](resource-management/overview.md), and [configuration management](configuration-management/overview.md). When policy focuses on risk and tolerance, the management disciplines can extend policy by applying proper risk mitigation to the chosen [deployment model](../getting-started/cloud-deployment-models.md).

## Next steps

The first step to taking action in any governance strategy is a [policy review](policy-compliance/what-is-a-cloud-policy-review.md). [Policy and compliance](policy-compliance/overview.md) is a useful guide during policy review. To prepare for a policy review, see the [guide to cloud readiness for chief information security officers (CISOs)](how-can-a-ciso-prepare-for-the-cloud.md).
