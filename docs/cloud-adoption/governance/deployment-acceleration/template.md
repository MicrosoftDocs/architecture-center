# Deployment Acceleration template

The first step to implementing change is communicating the desired change. The same is true when changing governance practices. The template below serves as a starting point for documenting and communicating policy statements that govern configuration and deployment issues in the cloud. The template also outlines the business criteria that may have led you to create the documented policy statements.

As your discussions progress, use this template's structure as a model for capturing the business risks, risk tolerances, compliance processes, and tooling needed to define your organization's Deployment Acceleration policy statements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is a limited sample. Before updating this template to reflect your requirements, you should review the subsequent steps for defining an effective Deployment Acceleration discipline within your cloud governance strategy.

## Next steps

Solid governance practices start with an understanding of business risk. Review the article on business risks and begin to document the business risks that align with your current cloud adoption plan.
