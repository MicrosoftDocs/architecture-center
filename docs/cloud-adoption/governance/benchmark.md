# Assess your transformation journey

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides a [governance benchmark tool](https://cafbaseline.com) to help you identify gaps in your organization across six key domains as defined in the framework. 

## Governance benchmark tool

The governance benchmark tool provides a personalized report that outlines the difference between your current state and business priorities, along with tailored resources to help you get started.
