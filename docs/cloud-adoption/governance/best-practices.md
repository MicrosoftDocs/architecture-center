# Improve your initial cloud governance foundation

This article assumes that you have established an [initial cloud governance foundation](./getting-started.md). As your cloud adoption plan is implemented, tangible risks will emerge from the proposed approaches by which teams want to adopt the cloud. As these risks surface in release planning conversations, use the following grid to quickly identify a few recommended practices for getting ahead of the adoption plan to prevent risks from becoming real threats.

## Maturity vectors

At any time, the following prescriptive guidance can be applied to the initial governance foundation to address the risk or need mentioned in the table below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resource organization can affect how this prescriptive guidance is applied. It is important to start with the recommendations that best align with the initial cloud governance foundation you implemented in the previous step.
