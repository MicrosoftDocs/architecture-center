# Fusion: Security Management discipline

Security Management is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md) within the [Fusion Model to Cloud Governance](../overview.md). Security is a component of any IT deployment, and the cloud introduces unique security concerns. Many businesses are subject to regulatory requirements that make protecting sensitive data a major organizational priority when considering a cloud transformation. Identifying potential security threats to your cloud environment and establishing processes and procedures for addressing these threats should be a priority for your cloud governance team.

> [!NOTE]
> Security management governance does not replace the existing IT teams, processes, and procedures that your organization uses to secure cloud-deployed resources. The primary purpose of this discipline is to identify security-related business risks and provide risk-mitigation guidance to the IT staff responsible for security infrastructure. As you develop governance policies and processes make sure to involve relevant IT teams in your planning and review processes.

This section of the Fusion guidance outlines the approach to developing a security management discipline as part of your cloud governance strategy. The primary audience for this guidance is your organization's cloud architects and other members of your cloud governance team. However, the decisions, policies, and processes that emerge from this discipline should involve engagement and discussions with relevant members of your IT and security teams, especially those technical leaders responsible for implementing networking, encryption, and identity services.

Making the correct security decisions is critical to the success of your cloud deployments and wider business success.  If your organization lacks in-house expertise in cyber-security, consider engaging with external security consultants as a component of this discipline. Also consider engaging with [Microsoft Consulting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/enterprise/services?activetab=pillars%3aprimaryr13), the [Microsoft FastTrack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/programs/azure-fasttrack/) cloud adoption service, or other external cloud adoption experts for discussion of Azure-specific concerns related security management.

## Policy statements

Actionable policy statements and the resulting architecture requirements serve as the foundation of a security management discipline. To see policy statement samples, see the article on [Security Management Policy Statements](./policy-statements.md). These samples can serve as a starting point for your organization's governance policies.

> [!CAUTION]
> The sample policies come from common customer experiences. To better align these policies to specific cloud governance needs, execute the following steps to create policy statements that meet your unique business needs. 

## Developing security management governance policy statements

The following six steps offer examples and potential options to consider when developing security management governance. Use each step as a starting point for discussions within your cloud governance team and with affected business, IT, and security teams across your organization to establish the policies and processes needed to mitigate security-related risks.
