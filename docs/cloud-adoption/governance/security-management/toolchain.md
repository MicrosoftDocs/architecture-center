# Fusion: What tools can help better manage security management in Azure?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Security Management is one of the five disciplines to Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies that protect the network, assets, and most importantly the data that will reside on a Cloud Provider's solution. Within the five disciplines of Cloud Governance, Security Management includes classification of the digital estate and data. It also includes documentation of risks, business tolerance, and mitigation strategies associated with the security of the data, assets, and network. From a technical perspective, this also includes involvement in decisions regarding [encryption](../../infrastructure/encryption/overview.md), [network requirements](../../infrastructure/software-defined-networks/overview.md), [hybrid identity strategies](../../infrastructure/identity/overview.md), and tools to [automate enforcement](../../infrastructure/policy-enforcement/overview.md) of security policies across [resource groups](../../infrastructure/resource-grouping/overview.md).

Unlike the cloud-agnostic position used throughout Fusion, this article is Azure specific. The following is a list of Azure native tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support security management.

| **Security requirement**                                       | **Azure tools/features**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
