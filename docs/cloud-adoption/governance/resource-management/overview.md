# Fusion: How can a company add Resource Management discipline to their Cloud Governance execution?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Resource Management is one of the five disciplines to Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies related to the operational management of an environment, application, or workload. Within the five disciplines of Cloud Governance, Resource management includes monitoring of applications, workload, and asset performance. It also includes the tasks required to meet scale demands, remediate performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations, and proactively avoid performance SLA violations through automated remediation.

This article outlines the Cost Management process that a company experiences during the planning, building, adopting, and operating phases of implementing a cloud solution. It's impossible for any one document to account for all of the requirements of any business. As such, each section of this article outlines suggested minimum and potential activities. The objective of these activities is to help you build a [Policy MVP](../policy-compliance/overview.md), but establish a framework for [Incremental Policy](../policy-compliance/overview.md) evolution. The Cloud Governance Team should decide how much to invest in these activities to improve the Resource Management position.

> [!CAUTION]
> Neither the minimum or potential activities outlined in this article are aligned to specific corporate policies or third party compliance requirements. This guidance is designed to help facilitate the conversations that will lead to alignment of both requirements with a Cloud Governance Model.

## Planning and readiness

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Plan process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/plan.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Evaluate your [Resource Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) options.
* Understand the licensing requirements for your cloud strategy.
* Develop a draft Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Become familiar with the resource manager you use to deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group.
* Educate and involve the people and teams impacted by the development of Architecture Guidelines.

**Potential activities**

* Define the resource grouping, naming, and tagging standards for your cloud solution.
* Determine whether you'll deploy [single team](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/governance/resource-management/governance-single-team?branch=brian%2FCOMIntegration) or [multiple team](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/governance/resource-management/governance-multiple-teams?branch=brian%2FCOMIntegration) governance strategy for your resources. 
* Determine your worlkload and account owners.
* Consider establishing a permissions model of least privilege where users have no permissions by default. 
* Establish cloud roles and responsibilities for access control to all services.
* Work with the business stakeholders and/or your [cloud strategy team](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/culture-strategy/what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team) to understand the desired [cloud accounting approach](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/business-strategy/cloud-accounting), cost accounting practices within your business units, and scalability needs for your organization as a whole.
* Evaluate existing operational monitoring tools to determine which ones, if any, that you would like to replace.

## Build and pre-deployment

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Build process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/build.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Implement your [Resource Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) by rolling out in a pre-deployment phase.
* Update the Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Develop educational materials and documentation, awareness communications, incentives and other programs to help drive user adoption.

**Potential activities**
* Authenticate users and authorize user access to resources.
* Enforce common configurations amongst resource groups to create proactive point-in-time governance.
* Leverage a resource grouping strategy to enforce architecture guidelines over time.
* Define dependencies between resources.
* Conduct access performance to measure the quality of services received.
* Implement [resource naming and tagging schemes](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/infrastructure/resource-tagging/overview?branch=brian%2FCOMIntegration) for your resrouces. 
* Ensure a consistent grouping structure by using a template deployment.
* Consider deploying [policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) to manage SLA enforcement using configuration settings and resource creation rules. 
* Create subscription patterns around application types or architypes with IT Ops as the department and account owners.
* Implement APIs and other exports used to pull logs from cloud native or centralized solutions.
* Determine wither all logging can be replicated to an on-premises, cloud gateway, or hybrid solution. 

## Adopt and migrate

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Migrate process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/migrate.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Migrate your [Resource Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) from pre-deployment to production.
* Update the Architecture Guidelines document and distribute to key stakeholders.
* Develop educational materials and documentation, awareness communications, incentives and other programs to help drive user adoption.
* Replicate all logging to an on-premises, cloud gateway, or hybrid solution. 


**Potential activities**
* Determine whether changes need to be made to managing your resources.
* Improve Ops by implementing efficient query capabilities across your adoption efforts. 
* Align resources to changing business needs and governance requirements.
* Ensure that your virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts reflect actual resource access needs during each release, and adjust as necessary.
* Review your access resources, resoure groups, and Azure subscriptions, and adjust as necessary.
* Monitor changes in resource access plans and validate with stakeholders if additional sign-offs are needed.
* Update changes to the Architecture Guidelines document to reflect actual costs.
* Determine whether your organization requires clearer financial alignment to P&Ls for business units.
* For global organizations, implement your SLA compliance or sovereignty requirements.
* For cloud aggregation, deploy a gateway solution to a cloud provider.
* For tools that don't allow for hyprid or gateway options, tightly couple monitoring with an operational monitoring tool.

## Operate and post-implementation

Once the transformation is complete, governance and operations must live on for the natural lifecycle of an  application or workload. This phase of governance maturity focuses on the activities that commonly come after the solution is implemented and the transformation cycle begins to stabilize.

**Minimum suggested activities**

* Customize your [Resource Management Tool Chain](toolchain.md) based on updates to your organizationâ€™s changing cost management needs.
* Consider automating any notifications and reports to reflect actual resource usage.
* Refine Architecture Guidelines to guide future adoption processes.
* Re-educate impacted teams on a periodic basis to ensure on-going adherence to the Architecture Guidelines.

**Potential activities**

* Adjust plans quarterly to reflect changes to actual resources.
* Automatically apply and enforce governance requirements during future deployments.
* Remediate underused resources and determine if they're worth continuing.
* Detect misalignments and anomalies between the plan and actual resource usage.
* Aid the Cloud Adoption Team and Cloud Strategy Team in understanding and resolving these anomalies. 
* Determine if changes needd to be made to resource management for billing and SLAs.
* Evaluate logging and monitoring tools to determine whether your on-premises, cloud gateway, or hybrid solution needs adjusting.
* For business units and geographically-distributed groups, determine if your organization should consider using management groups for meeting SLA requirements.
