# Fusion: Resource Management discipline

Resource Management is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md) within the [Fusion Model to Cloud Governance](../overview.md). 

This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies related to the operational management of an environment, application, or workload. Within the five disciplines of Cloud Governance, Resource management includes monitoring of applications, workload, and asset performance. It also includes the tasks required to meet scale demands, remediate performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations, and proactively avoid performance SLA violations through automated remediation.

> [!NOTE]
> Resource management governance does not replace the existing IT teams, processes, and procedures that allow your organization to effectively manage cloud-based resources. The primary purpose of this discipline is to identify potential resource management related business risks and provide risk-mitigation guidance to the IT staff that are responsible for managing your resources in the cloud. As you develop governance policies and processes make sure to  involve relevant IT teams in your planning and review processes.

This section of the Fusion guidance outlines how to develop a resource management discipline as part of your cloud governance strategy. The primary audience for this guidance is your organization's cloud architects and other members of your cloud governance team. However, the decisions, policies, and processes that emerge from this discipline should involve engagement and discussions with relevant members of the IT teams responsible for implementing and managing your organization's resource management solutions.

If your organization lacks in-house expertise in resource management strategies, consider engaging with external consultants as a part of this discipline. Also consider engaging with [Microsoft Consulting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/enterprise/services?activetab=pillars%3aprimaryr13), the [Microsoft FastTrack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/programs/azure-fasttrack/) cloud adoption service, or other external cloud adoption experts for discussing how best to organize, track, and optimize your cloud-based assets.

## Policy statements

Actionable policy statements and the resulting architecture requirements serve as the foundation of a resource management discipline. To see policy statement samples, see the article on [Resource Management Policy Statements](./policy-statements.md). These samples can serve as a starting point for your organization's governance policies.

> [!CAUTION]
> The sample policies come from common customer experiences. To better align these policies to specific cloud governance needs, execute the following steps to create policy statements that meet your unique business needs.

## Developing resource management governance policy statements

The following six steps offer examples and potential options to consider when developing resource management governance. Use each step as a starting point for discussions within your cloud governance team and with affected business, and IT teams across your organization to establish the policies and processes needed to mitigate resource management risks.
