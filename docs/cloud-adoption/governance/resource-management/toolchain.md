# Fusion: What tools can help better manage resource management in Azure?


In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Resource Management is one of the five disciplines to Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies related to the operational management of an environment, application, or workload. Within the five disciplines of Cloud Governance, Resource management includes monitoring of application, workload, and asset performance. It also includes the tasks required to meet scale demands, remediate performance SLA violations, and proactively avoid performance SLA violations through automated remediation.

Unlike the cloud-agnostic position throughout Fusion, this article is Azure specific. The following is a list of Azure native tools that can help mature the policies and processes that support this governance discipline.

When planning your deployment, you will need to consider where logging data is stored and how you integrate cloud-based [reporting and monitoring services](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/infrastructure/logs-and-reporting/overview) with your existing processes and tools. 

The following is a list of Azure native tools that can help with logging and monitoriing of resources that support this governance discipline.

|    | Azure Monitor  | Azure Monitor REST APIs  | Log Analytics |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Log, visualize, analyze and report on telemetry data generated by Azure resources  | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Analyze data and create alerts  | Yes | No | Yes | 
| Send telemetry data for integrated analysis and reporting  | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Capture telemetry data from applications and workloads  | Yes | Yes | No | 
| Integrate external services by automating monitoring and alerting   | Yes | Yes | No | 


Along with these resource management tools and features, you will need to [monitor your deployed resources](../monitoring-enforcement/overview.md) for performance and health issues. [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) is the default monitoring and reporting solution in Azure. 

|!Note
|Organizations also use third-party DevOps tools to monitor workloads and resources. For more information, see [DevOps Tool Integrations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops-tool-integrations/).
