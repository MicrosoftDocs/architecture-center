# Small-to-medium enterprise governance guide

## Overview of best practices

This governance guide follows the experiences of a fictional company through various stages of governance maturity. It is based on real customer experiences. The recommended practices are based on the constraints and needs of the fictional company.

As a quick starting point, this overview defines a minimum viable product (MVP) for governance based on prescriptive guidance. It also provides links to some governance improvements that add further recommended practices as new business or technical risks emerge.

> [!WARNING]
> This MVP is a baseline starting point, based on a set of assumptions. Even this minimal set of best practices is based on corporate policies driven by unique business risks and risk tolerances. To see if these assumptions apply to you, read the [longer narrative](./narrative.md) that follows this article.

### Governance best practices

These best practices serve as a foundation for an organization to quickly and consistently add governance guardrails across multiple Azure subscriptions.

### Resource organization

The following diagram shows the governance MVP hierarchy for organizing resources.

<!-- Same comment from large enterprise about linking together -->

Every application should be deployed in the proper area of the management group, subscription, and resource group hierarchy. During deployment planning, the cloud governance team will create the necessary nodes in the hierarchy to empower the cloud adoption teams.

1. A management group for each type of environment (such as Production, Development, and Test).
2. A subscription for each "application categorization".
3. A separate resource group for each application.
4. [Consistent nomenclature](../../../ready/considerations/name-and-tag.md) should be applied at each level of this grouping hierarchy.

Here is an example of this pattern in use:

These patterns provide room for growth without complicating the hierarchy unnecessarily.

## Iterative governance improvements

Once this MVP has been deployed, additional layers of governance can be incorporated into the environment quickly. Here are some ways to improve the MVP to meet specific business needs:

- [Security Baseline for protected data](./security-baseline-evolution.md)
- [Resource configurations for mission-critical applications](./resource-consistency-evolution.md)
- [Controls for Cost Management](./cost-management-evolution.md)
- [Controls for multicloud evolution](./multicloud-evolution.md)

## What does this guidance provide?

In the MVP, practices and tools from the [Deployment Acceleration](../../deployment-acceleration/index.md) discipline are established to quickly apply corporate policy. In particular, the MVP uses Azure Blueprints, Azure Policy, and Azure management groups to apply a few basic corporate policies, as defined in the narrative for this fictional company. Those corporate policies are applied using Resource Manager templates and Azure policies to establish a small baseline for identity and security.

## Incremental improvement of governance practices

Over time, this governance MVP will be used to improve governance practices. As adoption advances, business risk grows. Various disciplines within the Cloud Adoption Framework governance model will change to manage those risks. Later articles in this series discuss the incremental improvement of corporate policy affecting the fictional company. These improvements happen across three disciplines:

- Cost Management, as adoption scales.
- Security Baseline, as protected data is deployed.
- Resource Consistency, as IT Operations begins supporting mission-critical workloads.
