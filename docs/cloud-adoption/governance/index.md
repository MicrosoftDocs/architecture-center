# Governance in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

The cloud creates new paradigms regarding the technologies that support the business. These new paradigms also cause shifts in how those technologies are adopted, managed, and governed. When entire datacenters can be destroyed and re-created with one line of code executed from an unattended process, we have to rethink traditional approaches. This is equally true when it comes to governance.

For organizations with existing policies governing on-premises IT environments, cloud governance should complement those policies. However, the level of corporate policy integration between on-premises and the cloud will vary depending on cloud governance maturity and digital estate in the cloud. As the cloud estate evolves over time, so will cloud governance processes and policies.

The guidance in this section of the Cloud Adoption Framework is designed for two purposes:

- Provide actionable customer journeys that represent common experiences that customers often encounter. Each of these encapsulate business risks, corporate policies for risk mitigation, and design guidance to implement technical solutions. By necessity, the design guidance is specific to Azure. All other guidance in these journeys could be applied as part of a cloud-agnostic or multicloud approach.
- Help readers create personalized governance solutions that can meet a variety of business needs, including the governance of multiple public clouds, through detailed guidance on the development of corporate policies, processes, and tooling.

This content is intended for the Cloud Governance team. It is also relevant to cloud architects that need to develop a strong foundation in cloud governance.

## Intended Audience

The content in the Cloud Adoption Framework affects the business, technology, and culture of enterprises. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework will interact heavily with IT Security, IT Governance, Finance, line-of-business leaders, Networking, Identity, and cloud adoption teams. There are various co-dependencies on these personas which will require a facilitative approach by the cloud architects using this guidance. Facilitation with these teams may be a one-time effort, but in some cases, it will result in recurring interactions with these other personas.

The Cloud Architect serves as the thought leader and facilitator to bring these audiences together. The content in this collection of guides is designed to help the Cloud Architect facilitate the right conversation, with the right audience, to drive necessary decisions. Business transformation that is empowered by the cloud depends on the Cloud Architect to help guide decisions throughout the business and IT.

**Cloud Architect specialization in this section:** Each section of the Cloud Adoption Framework represents a different specialization or variant of the Cloud Architect role. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework is designed for cloud architects with a passion for mitigating or reducing technical risks. Some cloud providers refer to these specialists as *cloud custodians*, but we prefer *cloud guardians* or, collectively, the *Cloud Governance team*. In each actionable customer journey, the articles show how the composition and role of the Cloud Governance team may change over time.

## Using this guide

For readers who wish to follow this guide from beginning to end, this content will aid in developing a robust cloud governance strategy in parallel to cloud implementation. The guidance walks the reader through the theory and implementation of such a strategy.

For a crash course on the theory and quick access to Azure implementation, get started with the [Overview of actionable governance journeys](./journeys/index.md). Through this guidance, the reader can start small and evolve their governance needs in parallel with cloud adoption efforts.
