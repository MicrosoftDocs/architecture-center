# Example scenario for Automated Enterprise BI

This example scenario is relevant to organizations that want to build a data pipeline that integrates business data from multiple data sources into a cloud-scale platform that enables advanced analysis and business intelligence capabilities. Potential applications include e-commerce, retail, healthcare, government, or other industry applications involving large volumes of data that can deliver high business value through analysis. 

Using managed Azure services such as Data Factory, SQL Data Warehouse, and Analysis Services can help reduce costs by leveraging Microsoft's expertise in globally distributed cloud-scale data storage and analysis. If you have additional data service needs, you should review the list of available [fully managed intelligent database services in Azure][product-category].

## Potential use cases

Consider this solution for the following use cases:

* Creating and incrementally update a data warehouse that serves as a single source of truth for your organization's data.
* Integration of OLTP data with binary data or other non-relational datasets.
* Analysis of large datasets by business data analysts through a well-defined semantic model and robust visualization tools.

## Architecture

![Architecture for automated enterprise BI][architecture]

This example scenario is based on the [Azure automated enterprise BI reference architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/enterprise-bi-adf). The data flows through the solution as follows:

1. Data from each data source is periodically exported into Azure Blob storage, which serves as a staging area for the source data. Each export contains only the data that has changed since the previous export. 
2. Data Factory incrementally loads the staged data from Blob storage into staging tables in SQL Data Warehouse. Data cleansing is performed on the data in the staging tables before loading the data into the production data warehouse tables.
3. A predefined business intelligence semantic model. After a new batch of data is loaded into the warehouse, a previously created Analysis Services tabular model is refreshed. This provides a semantic model that simplifies the analysis of business data and relationships by business analysts.  
4. Business analysts use Power BI to perform analysis on the data in the warehouse via the Analysis Services semantic model.

### Components

* List of components with links to documentation.

* [SQL Server](/sql/sql-server) contains the source data located on on-premises. In this example scenario, an on-premises server is simulated using a virtual machine in Azure with SQL Server installed.
* [Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs) provides a staging area for the source data prior to loading it into SQL Data Warehouse.
* [Data Factory](/azure/data-factory) is a managed service that orchestrates and automates data movement and transformation. In this architecture, it orchestrates the stages of the ELT process.
* [SQL Data Warehouse](/azure/sql-data-warehouse) is a distributed system for performing analytics on large data. Its use of massive parallel processing (MPP) makes it suitable for running high-performance analytics.
* [Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services). Analysis Services is a fully managed service that provides data modeling capabilities. The semantic model is loaded into Analysis Services.
* [Power BI](/power-bi) Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools to analyze data and share insights. In this architecture, it queries the semantic model stored in Analysis Services.
* [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/) authenticates users who connect to the Analysis Services server through Power BI. Data Factory can also use Azure AD to authenticate to SQL Data Warehouse via a service principal or Managed Service Identity (MSI). For simplicity, this example scenario uses SQL Server authentication.

### Alternatives

* This example demonstrates using an on-premises SQL Server database and an external dataset as the data sources to integrate via the pipeline. However, this architecture is suitable for loading a wide range of both relational and non-relational data sources.
* Data Factory is designed for automating your data pipeline workflows. For one-time or on-demand jobs, you could also use available tools like SQL Server bulk copy (bcp) and AzCopy.
* If you are working with very large datasets, consider using Data Lake Storage, which provides limitless storage for analytics data.
 
## Considerations

### Availability

SQL Data Warehouse has [guaranteed SLAs](http://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/sql-data-warehouse/v1_0/) and [recommended practices for achieving high availability](http://azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-best-practices).

Azure Analysis Services also has [guaranteed SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/analysis-services/v1_0/) and [recommended practices for achieving high availability](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-bcdr).

For other availability topics, see the [availability checklist][availability] in the Azure Architecure Center.

### Scalability

The [massively parallel processing architecture](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/massively-parallel-processing-mpp-architecture) of SQL Data Warehouse provides scalability and high performance. [SQL Data Warehouse Gen2](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/memory-and-concurrency-limits) offers the greatest level of scale (up to 30,000 Data Warehouse Units) and providing unlimited columnar storage. You can also [scale SQL Data Warehouse on demand](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-manage-compute-overview), reducing or even pausing compute during periods of low demand or inactivity to lower your overall costs.

Azure Analysis Services can be [configured for scale-out](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-scale-out). With scale-out, client queries can be distributed among multiple query replicas in a query pool, reducing response times during high query workloads. You can also separate processing from the query pool, ensuring client queries are not adversely affected by processing operations. 

For other scalability topics, see the [scalability checklist][scalability] in the Azure Architecure Center.

### Security

The [SQL Data Warehouse security model](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-manage-security) provides connection security, [authentication and authorization](/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-authentication) via Azure AD or SQL Server authentication, and encryption. [Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-manage-users) uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity management and user authentication. 

For general guidance on designing secure solutions, see the [Azure Security Documentation][security].

### Resiliency

For general guidance on designing resilient solutions, see [Designing resilient applications for Azure][resiliency].

## Pricing

To explore the cost of running this solution, all of the services are pre-configured in the cost calculator.  To see how the pricing would change for your particular use case, change the appropriate variables to match your expected traffic.

We have provided three sample cost profiles based on amount of traffic you expect to get:

* [Small][small-pricing]: this correlates to a small data pipeline with part-time availability.
* [Medium][medium-pricing]: this correlates to a midsize data pipeline with full availabilty.
* [Large][large-pricing]: this correlates to a large data pipeline with full availability.
