# SaaS digital business journey on Azure

Follow this guidance to get the basics right when you build your software as a service (SaaS) on Azure.

## Evaluate Azure

Get informed and make the right platform and partnership decisions for your SaaS business.

- Complete your architecture in detail.
- Do a [Well Architected Framework Review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=local).
- Design your [billing and metering strategy](../multitenant/considerations/pricing-models.md).

## Deploy and publish your app

Ensure a successful deployment and launch to market.

- Deploy the production environment to your landing zone: see [Build your app](#build-your-app).
- Perform a [security review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=local) and review your [Azure secure score](/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls).
- Implement a customer metering strategy and create a [transactable marketplace offer](/azure/marketplace/plan-saas-offer).
- Launch your app.
