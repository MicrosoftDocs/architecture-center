# Virtual desktop architecture design

Migrating end-user desktops to the cloud helps improve employee productivity and enables employees to work from anywhere on a high-security cloud-based virtual desktop infrastructure.

Azure provides these virtual desktop solutions:

- [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop) is a desktop and application virtualization service.
- [Omnissa Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure](https://www.omnissa.com/products/horizon-cloud/) is an Omnissa service that simplifies the delivery of virtual desktops and applications on Azure by extending Azure Virtual Desktop.
- [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops for Azure](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops.html) is a desktop and app virtualization service that you can use to provision Windows desktops and apps on Azure with Citrix and Azure Virtual Desktop.
- [Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/dev-box) is a service that gives developers access to ready-to-code, project-specific workstations that are preconfigured and centrally managed in the cloud.

## Introduction to virtual desktop architecture on Azure

If you're new to virtual desktops on Azure, the best way to learn more is [Microsoft Learn training](/training/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online platform. Here's a learning path to get you started:

- [Deliver remote desktops and apps with Azure Virtual Desktop](/training/paths/m365-wvd)

## Path to production

Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides an end-to-end scenario to guide you through your virtual desktop migration or deployment. Start with [Migrate or deploy Azure Virtual Desktop instances to Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/azure-virtual-desktop), and check out the other articles below that one in the table of contents.

These are two more key Cloud Adoption Framework articles:

- [Azure Virtual Desktop planning](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/azure-virtual-desktop/plan)
- [Azure Virtual Desktop Azure landing zone review](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/azure-virtual-desktop/ready)

See [Understanding Azure Virtual Desktop network connectivity](/azure/virtual-desktop/network-connectivity?toc=/azure/architecture/toc.json&bc=/azure/architecture/_bread/toc.json) for a high-level overview of the network connections used by Azure Virtual Desktop.

## Best practices

### Azure Virtual Desktop for the enterprise

- [Azure Virtual Desktop for the enterprise](../../example-scenario/azure-virtual-desktop/azure-virtual-desktop.yml)

### FSLogix

FSLogix is designed for roaming profiles in remote computing environments like Azure Virtual Desktop. It stores a complete user profile in a single container. At sign-in, this container is dynamically attached to the computing environment. For more information, see these resources:

- [FSLogix configuration examples](/fslogix/concepts-configuration-examples)
- [FSLogix profile containers and Azure Files](/azure/virtual-desktop/fslogix-containers-azure-files?toc=/azure/architecture/toc.json&bc=/azure/architecture/_bread/toc.json)
