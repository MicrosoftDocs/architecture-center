This article briefly describes the steps for running [Samadii DEM](https://www.metariver.kr/smddem.html) on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Samadii DEM on Azure.

Samadii DEM analyzes and interprets large-scale particles at high speed. It uses a discrete element method (DEM), which is a Lagrangian method that determines the movement of particles by using the six-degrees-of-freedom equations of motion, taking into consideration all forces of individual particles. It uses explicit methods for time integration to calculate the position and velocity of the particles in the next time step.

Samadii DEM  supports the use of four friction models: the Constant model, the Coulomb model, the Viscous model, and the Coulomb-Viscous model.

It's used in the mechanical, electronic, chemical, and semiconductor industries.

## Why deploy Samadii DEM on Azure?

- Modern and diverse compute options to align to your workload's needs
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware
- Rapid provisioning
- Good scale and cost efficiency on NCasT4_v3-series VMs

### Components

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is
    used to create a Windows VM. For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Windows VMs on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is
    used to create a private network infrastructure in the cloud.
  - [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) are used to restrict access to the VM.  
  - A public IP address connects the internet to the VM.
- A physical solid-state drive (SSD) is used for storage.

## Compute sizing and drivers

Performance tests of Samadii DEM on Azure used [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), and [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) series VMs running Windows 10. The following table provides details about the VMs.

|VM size|vCPU|Memory, in GiB|Maximum data disks|	GPU|GPU memory, in GiB|Maximum uncached disk throughput, in IOPS / MBps|Temporary storage (SSD), in GiB|Maximum NICs|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Standard_ND96asr_v4|	96	|900|	32|	8|	40|	80,000 / 800|	6,000|	8|

|Standard_NC12s_v3	|12	|224	|24|	2|	32|	40,000 / 400|	1,474|	8|
|Standard_NC4as_T4_v3|	4|	28	|8	|1	|16	|-|	180|	2|
|Standard_NC64as_T4_v3|	64|	440|	32|	4|	64	|-|	2880|	8|

|Standard_NV24s_v3	|24	|224|	24|	2|	16	|40,000 / 400|	640	|8|

### Required drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) series VMs, you need to install NVIDIA GPU drivers.

To use AMD processors on [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), and [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) series VMs, you need to install AMD drivers.

## Samadii DEM installation

Before you install Samadii DEM, you need to deploy and connect a VM, install an eligible Windows 10 image, and install the required NVIDIA and AMD drivers.

For information about eligible Windows images, see [How to deploy Windows 10 on Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment) and [Use Windows client in Azure for dev/test scenarios](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NVIDIA Fabric Manager installation is required for VMs that use NVLink. ND_A100_v4 VMs use this technology. 

For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Run a Windows VM on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).

The product installation process involves installing a license server, installing Samadii DEM, and configuring the license server. For more information about installing Samadii DEM, contact [Metariver Technology](https://www.metariver.kr/index.html).

## Samadii DEM performance results

## Azure cost

The following tables present wall-clock times in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply these times by the Azure VM hourly costs for NVv3, NCasT4_v3, NCsv3, and NDA100v4 series VMs. For the current hourly costs, see [Windows Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#pricing).

Only simulation runtime is considered for these cost calculations. Application installation time and license costs aren't included. In some cases, the number of GPUs was artificially limited for the sake of testing.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the costs for your configuration.

### Costs, simple box

## Summary

- Samadii DEM was successfully tested on NDv4, NCv3, NCasT4_v3, and NVv3 VMs.
- Samadii DEM performs well on NCasT4_v3 and NCv3 VMs.
- We recommend NCasT4_v3 VMs with a one-GPU configuration because these VMs provide good scale-up and are cost efficient.
