This article briefly describes the steps for running [Ansys Fluent](https://www.ansys.com/products/fluids/ansys-fluent) on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Ansys Fluent on Azure.

Fluent is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) application that's used to model fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and more. Fluent provides:

- Task-based workflows, including multiphase modeling, batteries, shape optimization, and aerodynamics, for pre-processing the generation of a CFD-ready mesh for both clean and dirty CAD. 
- Accurate simulation of multiphase flows, including gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, gas-solid, particle flows, and DEM. 
- A range of turbulence models, including the GEKO model.

Fluent is used in the aerospace, automotive, medical, manufacturing, industrial equipment, communication, embedded systems, energy, and consumer goods industries. 

## Why deploy Ansys Fluent on Azure?

- Modern and diverse compute options to align to your workload's needs
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware
- Rapid provisioning
- Performance that scales well up to 64 or 96 CPUs on a single node and linearly on multiple nodes

## Components

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is
    used to create a Linux VM.
  - For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Linux VMs on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/linux-vm.yml).
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is
    used to create a private network infrastructure in the cloud.
  - [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) are used to restrict access to the VM.  
  -  A public IP address connects the internet to the VM.
- A physical solid-state drive (SSD) is used for storage.

## Compute sizing and drivers

Performance tests of Fluent on Azure used [HBv3-series](/azure/virtual-machines/hbv3-series) VMs running the Linux CentOS operating system. The following table provides details about HBv3-series VMs.

VM size|	vCPU|	Memory (GiB)|	Memory bandwidth GBps|	Base CPU frequency (Ghz)|	All-cores frequency (Ghz, peak)|	Single-core frequency (Ghz, peak)	|RDMA performance (Gbps)|	Maximum data disks|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Standard_HB120rs_v3|120|448|	350|	1.9|	3.0|	3.5|	200	|32|
|Standard_HB120-96rs_v3	|96	|448|	350	|1.9	|3.0	|3.5|	200	|32|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3	|64	|448|	350	|1.9	|3.0	|3.5|	200	|32|
|Standard_HB120-32rs_v3	|32	|448|	350	|1.9	|3.0	|3.5|	200	|32|
|Standard_HB120-16rs_v3	|16	|448|	350	|1.9	|3.0	|3.5|	200	|32|



### Required drivers

To use AMD CPUs on [HBv3 VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/hbv3-series), you need to install AMD drivers.

To use InfiniBand, you need to enable InfiniBand drivers.

## Fluent installation

Before you install Fluent, you need to deploy and connect a VM, install Linux, and install the required AMD and InfiniBand drivers.

For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Run a Linux VM on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/linux-vm.yml).

For information about installing Fluent, see the [Ansys website](https://www.ansys.com/products/fluids/ansys-fluent).

## Fluent performance results

HBv3 VMs with different numbers of vCPUs were deployed to determine the optimal configuration for Fluent on a single node. That optimal configuration was then tested in a multi-node cluster deployment. Ansys Fluent 2021 R2 was tested.

### Results, single-node configuration

The single-node configuration was evaluated for the following test cases.

### Results, multi-node configuration

As the preceding performance results show, HBv3-series VMs with 64 cores and 96 cores are optimal configurations. The performance improvement when you increase from 64 CPUs to 96 CPUs is between 5 and 10 percent. Taking license costs into consideration, the 64-CPU configuration is the best choice. Standard_HB120-64rs_v3 VMs, which have 64 cores, were used for the multi-node tests.

The multi-node configuration was evaluated for the same test cases.

## Azure cost

Only wall-clock time per 100 iterations of each model is considered for these cost calculations. Application installation time and license costs aren't considered.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the costs for your configuration.

For a single-node configuration, you can multiply the wall-clock times by the Azure hourly costs for HBv3-series VMs to compute total costs. For the current hourly costs, see [Linux Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#pricing). Here are the times for a single-node configuration:

|VM size|	 Number of CPUs|	Wall-clock time (hours)|
|-|-|-|
|Standard_HB120-16rs_v3|	16|	2.33|
|Standard_HB120-32rs_v3|	32|	1.48|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3|	64|	1.15|
|Standard_HB120-96rs_v3|	96|	1.06|
|Standard_HB120rs_v3	|120	|1.00|

For a multi-node configuration, you can multiply the wall-clock times by the number of nodes and the Azure hourly costs for HBv3-series VMs to compute total costs. For the current hourly costs, see [Linux Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#pricing). Here are the times for a multi-node configuration:

VM size|	Number of nodes|	Number of cores|	Wall-clock time (hours)|
|-|-|-|-|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3|	1	|64	|1.15|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3|	2	|128|	0.58|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3|	3|	192	|0.38|
|Standard_HB120-64rs_v3|	4|	256|	0.27|

## Summary

- Ansys Fluent 2021 R2 was successfully tested on HBv3-series Azure VMs.
- In single-node configurations, performance scaled well up to 64 or 96 CPUs. After that point, the speed increase dropped off.
- In multi-node configurations, performance scaled linearly as nodes were added.
