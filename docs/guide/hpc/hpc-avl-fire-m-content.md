This article describes the steps for running the [AVL FIRE M](https://www.avl.com/fire-m) application on a virtual machine (VM) and a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster that's deployed on Azure. The article also shows the performance results of running AVL FIRE M on Azure CycleCloud (an Azure HPC cluster).

AVL FIRE M is the leading computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation package for internal-combustion engines. In the new era of electromobility, it has evolved into a comprehensive software tool offering solutions for a wide spectrum of applications. It simulates:

- Fluid flow and thermal load in power train and vehicle components.
- Vehicle aerodynamics.
- Complex multi-fluid and multiphase flows.
- Efficient and reliable solutions for electrification, such as virtual development and integration of electric driveline, battery, and fuel cells.

Designed to accurately simulate relevant physics and chemistry, AVL FIRE M enables predictive simulations of fuel sprays, ignition, combustion, and engine-out emissions. It also shows how to tailor components of exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. And it provides models for electrochemistry and thermal behavior of batteries and fuel cells.

AVL FIRE M provides:

- Efficient solutions to solve demanding flow problems in various applications and industries.
- Accurate simulation of heat transfer and thermal load problems.
- Qualified and task-oriented software support along with application method development.

### Required drivers

To use InfiniBand, you need to [enable InfiniBand drivers](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/hpc/enable-infiniband).

## AVL FIRE M 2022 R1 installation

Before you install AVL FIRE M, you deploy and connect a VM or an Azure HPC cluster.

For more information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see either [Run a Windows VM on Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm) or [Run a Linux VM on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/linux-vm.yml).

For more information on deploying the Azure CycleCloud and Azure HPC cluster, see these resources.

- [Create an Azure HPC cluster](/training/modules/azure-cyclecloud-high-performance-computing/5-exercise-create-cluster)

You can download AVL FIRE M products on the AVL self-service portal. Alternately, you can install the application without downloading the large installation image by running the installer executable (AVL SETUP.run).

## AVL FIRE M 2022 R1 performance results

For the performance results, AVL FIRE M ran steady state simulations. The following are details on the models used for AVL FIRE M performance validation on Virtual Machines.

DrivAer_BodyFitted: Open Cooling DrivAer Notchback is a realistic test case that's relevant to the automotive industry and accepted as the standard for automotive CFD correlation. For more information, see the [DrivAer_BodyFitted SAE technical paper](https://doi.org/10.4271/2021-01-0958) by Hupertz, B., Chalupa, K., Krueger, L., Howard, K. et al., _On the Aerodynamics of the Notchback Open Cooling DrivAer: A Detailed Investigation of Wind Tunnel Data for Improved Correlation and Reference_, (SAE Int. J. Adv. & Curr. Prac. in Mobility 3(4):1726-1747,- 2021).

DrivAer_EmbeddedBody: Embedded body approach in AVL FIRE M, requires practically no conventional meshing and is an alternative to the standard (body-fitted) for the comparative assessment. For more information, see the [DrivAer_EmbeddedBody SAE technical paper](https://doi.org/10.4271/2022-01-0889) by Basara, B., Zunic, Z., Pavlovic, Z., Sampl, P. et al., _Performance Analysis of Immersed Boundary Method for Predicting External Car Aerodynamics_ (SAE Technical Paper 2022-01-0889, 2022).

> To get a better speedup, there must be a minimum of 20,000 cells per CPU for a single-phase incompressible flow simulation.

More notes about the tests:

- Both models demonstrate good CPU acceleration in all multi-node setups.
- This research is limited to a few iterations. But in real-world circumstances, iterations can be more numerous, so you can minimize decomposition time in the total run time, allowing performance to be improved even further.
- For small problems, we recommend using fewer CPUs to get better performance.

## Azure cost

Only elapsed solver running time (total run time) was considered for these cost calculations. Application installation time isn't considered. The calculations are relative. The actual numbers depend on the size of the model.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs for your configuration. The following tables provide elapsed times in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply by the number of nodes and Virtual Machine hourly costs. For the current hourly costs, see [Linux Virtual Machines pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#pricing).
