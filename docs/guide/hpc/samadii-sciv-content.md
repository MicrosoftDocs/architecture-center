This article briefly describes the steps for running [Samadii SCIV](https://www.metariver.kr/smdsciv.html) on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Samadii SCIV on Azure.

Samadii SCIV (Statistical Contact in Vacuum) analyzes fluid behavior, deposition processes, and chemical reactions on rarefied gas regions by using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. To calculate the physical phenomena represented by the Boltzmann equation, the DSMC method uses representative particles, which replace the real molecules. SCIV also provides functions for traditional flow simulation, display deposition processes, and semiconductor device analysis in rarefied gas regions.

SCIV is used by manufacturers of display devices and semiconductors, in aerospace, and in other industries.

## Why deploy Samadii SCIV on Azure?

- Modern and diverse compute options to meet your workload's needs
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware
- Rapid provisioning
- Strong performance scale-up, with configurations that provide optimized scaling or optimized cost efficiency

### Components

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is
    used to create a Windows VM. For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Windows VMs on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is
    used to create a private network infrastructure in the cloud.
  - [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) are used to restrict access to the VM.  
  - A public IP address connects the internet to the VM.
- A physical solid-state drive (SSD) is used for storage.

## Compute sizing and drivers

The performance tests of Samadii SCIV on Azure used [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), and [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) VMs running Windows 10. The following table provides details about the VMs.

|VM size|	GPU name|	vCPU|	Memory, in GiB|	Maximum data disks|	GPU	|GPU memory, in GiB|	Maximum uncached disk throughput, IOPS / MBps)|	Temporary storage (SSD), in GiB|	Maximum NICs|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Standard_NV12s_v3|	Tesla M60|	12|	112|	12|	1|	8|	20,000 / 200|	320|	4|
|Standard_NC4as_T4_v3|	Tesla T4	|4|	28|	8|	1	|16	|-|	180|	2|
|Standard_NC6s_v3	|V100|	6	|112|	12	|1	|16|	20,000 / 200|	736|	4|
|Standard_ND96asr_v4|	A100|	96	|900	|32|	8	|40	|80,000 / 800	|6,000	|8|

### Required drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), and [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) VMs, you need to install NVIDIA GPU drivers.

To use AMD processors on [NCas_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), and [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) VMs, you need to install AMD drivers.

## Samadii SCIV installation

Before you install SCIV, you need to deploy and connect a VM, install an eligible Windows 10 image, and install the required NVIDIA and AMD drivers.

For information about eligible Windows images, see [How to deploy Windows 10 on Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment) and [Use Windows client in Azure for dev/test scenarios](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NVIDIA Fabric Manager installation is required for VMs that use NVLink. ND_A100_v4 VMs use this technology.

For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Run a Windows VM on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).

The product installation process involves installing a license server, installing Samadii SCIV, and configuring the license server. For more information about installing SCIV, contact [Metariver Technology](https://www.metariver.kr/index.html).

## Samadii SCIV performance results

Windows 10 Professional, version 20H2, with an x86-64 architecture, was used for all tests. The following table shows the processors that were used.

||ND_A100_v4	|NCv3	|NCas_T4_v3	|NVv3|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Processor|	AMD EPYC 7V12, 64-core processor, 2.44 GHz (2 processors)	|Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690 v4|	AMD EPYC 7V12, 64-core processor, 2.44 GHz	|Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690 v4|

The PNS model was used for testing.

The following table shows the elapsed runtimes and relative speed increases on the four VMs.

|VM |	Elapsed time, in seconds	|Relative speed increase|
|-|-|-|
|NVv3|93,483.74	|1.00|
|NCas_T4_v3	|38,311.8|2.44|
|NCv3	|27,096.83|3.45|
|ND_A100_v4	|16,322.98|5.73|

This graph shows the relative speed increases:

## Azure cost

The following table presents wall-clock times in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply these times by the Azure VM hourly costs for NVv3, NCasT4_v3, NCsv3, and NDA100v4 VMs. For the current hourly costs, see [Windows Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#pricing).

Only simulation runtime is considered in these cost calculations. Application installation time and license costs aren't included.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the costs for your configuration.

|VM size|	Number of GPUs|		Wall-clock time, in hours|
|-|-|-|
|Standard_NV12s_v3|	1		|25.97|
|Standard_NC4as_T4_v3|	1|		10.64|
|Standard_NC6s_v3	|1		|7.53|
|Standard_ND96asr_v4|	8	|	4.53|

## Summary

- Samadii SCIV was successfully tested on NDv4, NCv3, NCasT4_v3, and NVv3 VMs.
- SCIV performance scales well on NCasT4_v3, NCv3, and NDv4 VMs.
- The NCasT4_v3 VM performs well and is cost efficient.
