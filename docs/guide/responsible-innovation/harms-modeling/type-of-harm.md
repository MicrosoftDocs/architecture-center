# Types of harm

This article creates awareness for the different types of harms, so that appropriate mitigation steps can be implemented.

## Risk of injury

### Physical injury

Consider how technology could hurt people or create dangerous environments.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|
> |**Overreliance on safety features**|This points out the dependence on technology to make decisions without adequate human oversight.|How might people rely on this technology to keep them safe? How could this technology reduce appropriate human oversight?|A healthcare agent could misdiagnose illness, leading to unnecessary treatment.|
> |**Inadequate fail-safes**|Real-world testing may insufficiently consider a diverse set of users and scenarios.|If this technology fails or is misused, how would people be impacted? At what point could a human intervene? Are there alternative uses that have not been tested for? How would users be impacted by a system failure?|If an automatic door failed to detect a wheelchair during an emergency evacuation, a person could be trapped if there isn't an accessible override button.|
> |**Exposure to unhealthy agents**|Manufacturing, as well as disposal of technology can jeopardize the health and well-being of workers and nearby inhabitants.|What negative outcomes could come from the manufacturing of your components or devices?|Inadequate safety measures could cause workers to be exposed to toxins during digital component manufacturing.|

### Emotional or psychological injury

Misused technology can lead to serious emotional and psychological distress.

> |**Overreliance on automation**|Misguided beliefs can lead users to trust the reliability of a digital agent over that of a human.|How could this technology reduce direct interpersonal feedback? How might this technology interface with trusted sources of information? How could sole dependence on an artificial agent impact a person?|A chat bot could be relied upon for relationship advice or mental health counseling instead of a trained professional.|

## Infringement on human rights

### Dignity loss

Technology can influence how people perceive the world, and how they recognize, engage, and value one another. The exchange of honor and respect between people can be interfered with.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|

### Privacy loss

Information generated by our use of technology can be used to determine facts or make assumptions about someone without their knowledge.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|
> |**Interference with private life**|Revealing information a person has not chosen to share.|How could this technology use information to infer portions of a private life?

### Social detriment

At scale, the way technology impacts people shapes social and economic structures within communities. It can further ingrain elements that include or benefit some, at the exclusion of others.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|
> |**Amplification of power inequality**|This may perpetuate existing class or privilege disparities.|How might this technology be used in contexts where there are existing social, economic, or class disparities?

Conversely, how might unique forms of expression be suppressed. In what ways might the data gathered by this technology be used in feedback to people?|Limited customization options in designing a video game avatar inhibits self-expression of a player's diversity.|
> |**Loss of representation**|Broad categories of generalization obscure, diminish, or erase real identities.|How could this technology constrain identity options? Could it be used to automatically label or categorize people?|Automatic photo caption assigns incorrect gender identity and age to the subject.|
> |**Skill degradation and complacency**|Overreliance on automation leads to atrophy of manual skills.|In what ways might this technology reduce the accessibility and ability to use manual controls?|Overreliance on automation could lead to an inability to gauge the airplane's true orientation because the pilots have been trained to rely on instruments only.|

## Evaluate harms

Once you have generated a broad list of potential harms, you should complete your Harms Model by evaluating the potential magnitude for each category of harm. This will allow you to prioritize your areas of focus. See the following example harms model for reference:

|Contributing factor   |Definition       |
|----------------------|-----------------|
|Severity        |How acutely could an individual or group's well-being be impacted by the technology?        |
|Scale           |How broadly could the impact to well-being be experienced across populations or groups?    |
|Probability     |How likely is it that individual or group's well-being will be impacted by the technology? |
|Frequency       |How often would an individual or group experience an impact to their well-being from the technology? |

## Next Steps

Use the Harms Model you developed to guide your product development work:

- Seek more information from stakeholders that you identified as potentially experiencing harm.
- Develop and validate hypothesis for addressing the areas you identified as having the highest potential for harm.
- Integrate the insights into your decisions throughout the technology development process: data collection and model training, system architecture, user experience design, product documentation, feedback loops, and communication capabilities and limitations of the technology.
