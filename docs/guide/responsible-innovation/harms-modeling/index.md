# Foundations of assessing harm

Harms modeling is a practice that helps you anticipate the potential for harm, identify gaps in product that could put people at risk, and ultimately create approaches that proactively address harm.

This guidance is for architects who design algorithm-driven systems, such as custom-coded decision-making frameworks. It also applies to outsourced decision-making processes, such as processes that involve AI or machine learning models.

As technology builders, your work has a global impact. To design trustworthy algorithm-driven systems, you need to create solutions that reflect ethical principles that are rooted in important and timeless human values. During the design and development process, you must evaluate not only ideal outcomes for your users but also possible negative outcomes, known as *harms*. These harms can occur in any decision-making architecture that doesn't involve human oversight.

> For guidance that's specific to responsible AI, see [Responsible AI principles and approach](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach).

## Stakeholder considerations

To build trustworthy systems, recognize and value human rights as a fundamental aspect and consider the perspectives of many people. To design and build better products, you should ask who the stakeholders are, what they value, how they could benefit from your technology, and how they could be hurt by your technology.

Who are the customers for your technology?

- What do they value?
- How should they benefit from your technology?
- How could your technology harm them?

Who are the noncustomer stakeholders?

- What do they value?
- How should they benefit from your technology?
- How could your technology harm them?

Ask these questions to get a better understanding of what's important to stakeholders and how those aspects influence their relationship with the product.

## Types of harm

The following tables describe various types of harm that technology users might encounter. They include a diverse range of harms that can affect people in different scenarios, but it isn't exhaustive. Your workload might have the potential to lead to other types of harms that aren't listed.

### Risk of injury

#### Physical injury

Consider how technology might hurt people or create dangerous environments.

|Harm|Description|Considerations|Example|
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
|**Overreliance on safety features**|A dependence on technology to make decisions without adequate human oversight.|How might people rely on this technology to keep them safe? <br><br> How could this technology reduce appropriate human oversight?|A healthcare agent misdiagnoses illness, which leads to unnecessary treatment.|
|**Inadequate fail-safes**|Real-world testing doesn't cover a diverse set of users and scenarios.|If this technology fails or is misused, how does it affect people? <br><br> At what point could a human intervene? <br><br> Are there alternative uses that you haven't tested? <br><br> How does a system failure affect users?|An automatic door doesn't detect a wheelchair during an emergency evacuation, so a person is trapped if there isn't an accessible override button.|

|Harm|Description|Considerations|Example|
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|

#### Social detriment

At scale, the way that technology affects people shapes social and economic structures within communities. It can further ingrain elements that include or benefit some people while excluding others.

|Harm|Description|Considerations|Example|
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
|**Amplification of power inequality**|Perpetuating existing class or privilege disparities.|How might this technology be used in contexts that have existing social, economic or class disparities? <br><br> How might people with more power or privilege disproportionately influence this technology?|A job website requires a residential address and phone number to register, which prevents a homeless person from applying.|

|**Skill degradation and complacency**|Overreliance on automation leads to atrophy of manual skills.|How might this technology reduce the accessibility and ability to use manual controls?|Pilots can't gauge an airplane's true orientation because they're trained to rely on instruments only.|

## Define harms that are specific to your workloads

Use the previous categories, questions, and examples to generate specific ideas for how harm could occur within your workload. Adapt and adopt other categories that are relevant to your scenario.

You can complete this harms modeling activity individually, but ideally, you should collaborate with stakeholders. When you design and implement the technology, involve developers, data scientists, designers, user researchers, business decision-makers, and other disciplines.

- **Intended use:** If [feature] is used for [use case], then [stakeholder] could experience [harm description].

- **Unintended use:** If [user] tried to use [feature] for [use case], then [stakeholder] could experience [harm description].
- **System error:** If [feature] failed to function properly when used for [use case], then [stakeholder] could experience [harm description].
- **Misuse:** [Malicious actor] could potentially use [feature] to cause [harm description] to [stakeholder].

### Use transparency documents

Some services provide [transparency documents](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach#transparency-report). Transparency documents provide insights into how the service operates, its capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations. You can review these documents to understand the inner workings of the service and help ensure responsible use.
 
When you build solutions on Azure, read through any transparency documents that your service offers. Factor in how those solutions align with your workload's harms modeling. Consider whether the service's functionalities and limitations introduce or mitigate risks in your specific use case.

## Evaluate harms

After you generate a broad list of potential harms, evaluate the potential magnitude for each harm category. This step prioritizes your areas of focus. Consider the following factors.

| Contributing factor | Definition |
| :------------------ | :--------- |
| Severity            | How acutely could the technology affect an individual or group's well-being? |
| Scale               | How broadly could the impact on well-being be experienced across populations or groups? |
| Probability         | How likely is the technology to affect an individual or group's well-being? |
| Frequency           | How often could the technology affect an individual or group's well-being? |
