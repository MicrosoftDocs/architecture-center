# DevOps architecture design

The term *DevOps* derives from *development* and *operations*. It refers to the integration of development, quality assurance, and IT operations into a unified culture and set of processes for delivering software. For an overview of DevOps, see [What is DevOps?](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops).

DevOps includes these activities and operations:

- **Continuous integration (CI)** is the practice of merging all developer code into a central codebase frequently, and then performing automated build and test processes. The objectives are to quickly discover and correct code issues, to streamline deployment, and to ensure code quality. For more information, see [What is Continuous Integration?](/devops/develop/what-is-continuous-integration).
- **Continuous delivery (CD)** is the practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying code to production-like environments. The objective is to ensure that code is always ready to deploy. Adding continuous delivery to create a full CI/CD pipeline helps you detect code defects as soon as possible. It also ensures that properly tested updates can be released in a short time. For more information, see [What is Continuous Delivery?](/devops/deliver/what-is-continuous-delivery).
- **Continuous deployment** is an additional process that automatically takes any updates that have passed through the CI/CD pipeline and deploys them into production. Continuous deployment requires robust automatic testing and advanced process planning. It might not be appropriate for all teams.
- **Continuous monitoring** refers to the process and technology required to incorporate monitoring across each phase of DevOps and IT operations lifecycles. Monitoring helps to ensure the health, performance, and reliability of your application and infrastructure as the application moves from development to production. Continuous monitoring builds on the concepts of CI and CD.

## Introduction to DevOps on Azure

If you need to know more about DevOps, or DevOps on Azure, the best place to learn is [Microsoft Learn](/learn). It's a free, online platform that provides interactive training for Microsoft products and more. There are videos, tutorials, and hands-on learning for specific products and services, plus learning paths based on job role, such as developer or data analyst. If you're not familiar with Learn you can take [a tour of Microsoft Learn](/teamblog/microsoft-learn-tour) or [a quick video tour of Microsoft Learn](/shows/azure-friday/learning-azure-part-3-a-quick-tour-of-microsoft-learn).

After you're familiar with Azure, you can decide whether to follow learning paths specific to DevOps, such as:

- [Get started with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices)
- [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops)
- [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops)

## Path to production

Plan your path to production by reviewing:

- [DevOps guides](#devops-guides)
- [Azure services that are often used in implementing DevOps solutions](#azure-devops-services)
- [Example DevOps architectures](#example-devops-architectures)

The framework comprises five pillars: Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, and Performance Efficiency. Here's where to find documentation of the pillars:

- [Reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency)
- [Security](/azure/architecture/framework/security)
- [Cost Optimization](/azure/architecture/framework/cost)
- [Operational Excellence](/azure/architecture/framework/devops)
- [Performance Efficiency](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability)
