# Considerations for using Azure Container Apps in a multitenant solution

You can use Azure Container Apps to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. This article describes several features of Container Apps that are useful for multitenant solutions. It also provides resources that can help you during your planning phase.

## Isolation models

When you work with a multitenant system that uses Container Apps, you need to determine the required level of isolation. Container Apps supports different models of multitenancy:

- You can implement *trusted multitenancy* by using a shared environment. For example, this model might be suitable when your tenants are all from within your organization.

- You can implement *hostile multitenancy* by deploying separate environments for each tenant. For example, this model might be suitable when you don't trust the code that your tenants run.

The following table summarizes the differences between the main tenancy isolation models for Container Apps. The models are described later in this article.

| Consideration | One environment for each tenant | Tenant-specific container apps | Shared container apps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Data isolation | High | Low | Low |
| Performance isolation | High | Medium, no network isolation | Low |
| Deployment complexity | Medium | Low to medium | Low |
| Operational complexity | Medium | Low | Low |
| Resource cost | High | Low | Low |
| Example scenario | Runs hostile multitenant workloads in isolated environments for security and compliance. |  Optimizes cost, networking resources, and operations for trusted multitenant applications. | Implements a multitenant solution at the business-logic level. |

### Shared container apps

Consider deploying shared container apps in a single Container Apps environment that all your tenants use.

All tenants share a single Container Apps environment and container apps." lightbox="./media/container-apps/shared-container-apps.svg":::
   The image shows Tenant A, Tenant B, and Tenant C. Three arrows point from each of these tenants to the Shared Container Apps environment section that contains the text Tenants A, B, C.
:::image-end:::

This approach is typically cost-efficient and requires the least operational overhead because there are fewer resources to manage.

However, if you want to use this isolation model, your application code must be multitenancy-aware. This isolation model doesn't guarantee isolation at the network, compute, monitoring, or data level. Your application code must handle tenant isolation. This model isn't suitable for hostile multitenancy workloads in which you don't trust the code that's running.

This model is potentially subject to [noisy neighbor concerns](../../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml), which means that one tenant's workload might affect the performance of another tenant's workload. If you need to provide dedicated throughput to mitigate this concern, the shared container apps model might not be suitable.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Deployment Stamps pattern](../../../patterns/deployment-stamp.yml) is useful when tenants are on different pricing models. For example, tenants might be assigned to shared or dedicated Container Apps environments depending on their pricing tier. This deployment strategy allows you to go beyond the Container Apps limit for a single subscription for each region and scale linearly as the number of tenants grows.

### Tenant-specific container apps

Another approach that you might consider is isolating your tenants by deploying tenant-specific container apps within a shared environment.

:::image type="complex" border="false" source="./media/container-apps/container-apps-tenant.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a Container Apps isolation model in which tenant-specific container apps are deployed within a shared Container Apps environment." lightbox="./media/container-apps/container-apps-tenant.svg":::
   The image shows a Container Apps isolation model in which tenant-specific container apps are deployed within a shared Container Apps environment. The image includes icons that represent Tenant A, Tenant B, and Tenant C. Three arrows point from these icons to the corresponding Tenant A, Tenant B, and Tenant C icons in the shared Container Apps environment.
:::image-end:::

This isolation model ensures logical separation between tenants while providing several advantages:

- **Cost efficiency.** By sharing a Container Apps environment, virtual network, and other attached resources like a Log Analytics workspace, you can generally reduce your overall cost and management complexity for each tenant.

- **Separation of upgrades and deployments.** Each tenant's application binaries can be deployed and upgraded independently from the binaries of other container apps in the same environment. This approach can be useful if you need to upgrade different tenants to specific versions of your code at different times.

- **Resource isolation.** Each container app within your environment is allocated its own CPU and memory resources. If a specific tenant requires more resources, you can allocate more CPU and memory to that tenant's specific container app. Keep in mind that there are [limits on total CPU and memory allocations](/azure/container-apps/containers#configuration) on container apps.

However, this approach provides no hardware or network isolation between tenants. All container apps in a single environment share the same virtual network. You must be able to trust that the workloads deployed to the apps don't misuse the shared resources.

Container Apps has built-in support for Dapr, which uses a modular design to deliver functionality as [components](/azure/container-apps/dapr-overview). In Container Apps, Dapr components are environment-level resources. When you share a single environment across multiple tenants, ensure that Dapr components are properly scoped to the correct tenant-specific container app to guarantee isolation and prevent data leakage.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use [revisions](/azure/container-apps/revisions) to create different versions of your app for different tenants. Revisions don't provide resource isolation. They're designed for deployment scenarios where multiple versions of an app must run during an update rollout. This approach includes strategies like blue-green deployments and A/B testing.

### One environment for each tenant

Consider deploying one Container Apps environment for each of your tenants. A [Container Apps environment](/azure/container-apps/environment) is the isolation boundary around a group of container apps. An environment provides compute and network isolation on the data plane. Each environment is deployed in to its own virtual network. All apps within the environment share this virtual network. Each environment has its own Dapr and monitoring configuration.

:::image type="complex" border="false" source="./media/container-apps/environments-tenant.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a Container Apps isolation model in which each tenant gets its own Container Apps environment." lightbox="./media/container-apps/environments-tenant.svg":::
   The image contains icons that represent Tenant A, Tenant B, and Tenant C. Arrows point from these icons to their individual corresponding Container Apps environment. The three tenant environments are Tenant A, Tenant B, and Tenant C.
:::image-end:::

This approach provides the strongest level of data and performance isolation because each tenant's data and traffic are isolated to a specific environment. This model doesn't require your applications to be multitenancy-aware. When you use this approach, you have more granular control over how you allocate resources to container apps within the environment. You can determine allocations based on your tenant's requirements. For example, some tenants might require more CPU and memory resources than others, so you can provide more resources to these tenants' applications while benefiting from the isolation that tenant-specific environments provide.

However, there are low [limits on the number of environments that you can deploy within a subscription for each region](/azure/container-apps/quotas). In some scenarios, you can increase these quotas by creating an [Azure support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket).

Ensure that you know the expected growth in the number of tenants before you implement this isolation model. This approach often incurs a higher total cost of ownership and higher levels of deployment and operational complexity because of the extra resources that you need to deploy and manage.

## Container Apps features that support multitenancy

### Custom domain names

Container Apps enables you to use [wildcard Domain Name System (DNS) and to add your own wildcard Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates](/azure/container-apps/custom-domains-certificates#add-a-custom-domain-and-certificate). When you use tenant-specific subdomains, both wildcard DNS and TLS certificates enable you to easily scale your solution to a large number of tenants without needing to manually reconfigure each new tenant.

In Container Apps, you manage certificates at the environment level. [Ingress](/azure/container-apps/ingress) must also be enabled for the container app before you can bind a custom domain to it.

### Request authentication and authorization

Container Apps can [validate authentication tokens on behalf of your app](/azure/container-apps/authentication#feature-architecture). If a request doesn't contain a token, the token isn't valid, or the request isn't authorized, you can configure Container Apps to either block the request or redirect the request to your identity provider so that the user can sign in.

If your tenants use Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider, you can configure Container Apps to use the [/common endpoint](/entra/identity-platform/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant#update-your-code-to-send-requests-to-common) to validate user tokens. This approach ensures that users' tokens are validated and accepted, regardless of the user's Microsoft Entra tenant.

You can also integrate Container Apps with Microsoft Entra External ID for user authentication via partner identity providers.

For more information, see the following resources:

- [Container Apps authorization](/azure/container-apps/authentication)
- [Enable authentication and authorization in Container Apps with Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/container-apps/authentication-azure-active-directory)

> [!NOTE]
> The authentication and authorization features in Container Apps are similar to the features in Azure App Service. However, there are some differences. For more information, see [Considerations for using built-in authentication](/azure/container-apps/authentication#considerations-for-using-built-in-authentication).

### Managed identities

You can use managed identities from Microsoft Entra ID to enable your container app to access other resources that Microsoft Entra ID authenticates. When you use managed identities, your container app doesn't need to manage credentials for service-to-service communication. You can grant specific permissions to your container app's identity for role-based access control.

When you use managed identities, keep your choice of isolation model in mind. For example, suppose that you share your container apps among all your tenants and deploy tenant-specific databases. You need to ensure that one tenant's application can't access a different tenant's database.

For more information, see [Managed identities in Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/managed-identity).

### Workload profiles on dedicated compute

Container Apps provides a dedicated plan that allows you to reserve dedicated resources for a tenant. This plan is useful for limiting the resources available to a tenant, which can be shared across multiple container apps. It also helps meet specific tenant requirements, such as higher memory-to-CPU ratios or GPU availability.

For more information, see [Workload profiles in Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/workload-profiles-overview).

### Rule-based routing

Rule‑based routing lets you direct inbound traffic to specific container apps or container app revisions. Requests can be routed based on the HTTP request path, and you can rewrite the path in the URL. This feature is useful for multitenant systems that need to [map requests](../considerations/map-requests.yml) to tenant‑specific container apps or revisions that use the path in the request. This capability is typically used with the [tenant-specific container apps](#tenant-specific-container-apps) isolation model.

For more information, see [Use rule-based routing with Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/rule-based-routing).
