# Related resources for multitenancy

This article provides a set of links and resources for architects and developers of multitenant solutions.


## Architectures for multitenant applications

The following articles provide examples of multitenant architectures on Azure.

| Architecture | Summary | Technology focus |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| [Multitenant software as a service (SaaS) on Azure](../../example-scenario/multi-saas/multitenant-saas.yml) | Reference architecture for a multitenant SaaS scenario on Azure, which is deployed in multiple regions | Web |
| [Use Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with a multitenant Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](../../example-scenario/aks-agic/aks-agic.yml) | Example for how to implement multitenancy with AKS and AGIC | Kubernetes |
| [All multitenant architectures](../../browse/index.yml?terms=multitenant) | Lists all the architectures that include multitenancy | Multiple |

## Cloud design patterns

The following [cloud design patterns](../../patterns/index.md) are frequently used in multitenant architectures.

| Pattern | Summary |
| ------- | ------- |
| [Deployment Stamps pattern](../../patterns/deployment-stamp.yml) | Deploy multiple independent copies (or scale units) of application components, including data stores. |
| [Federated Identity](../../patterns/federated-identity.yml) | Delegate authentication to an external identity provider. |
| [Gatekeeper](../../patterns/gatekeeper.yml) | Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance that serves as a broker between clients and the application or service, validates and sanitizes requests, and passes requests and data between them. |
| [Queue-Based Load Leveling](../../patterns/queue-based-load-leveling.yml) | Use a queue that serves as a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes in order to smooth intermittent heavy loads. |
| [Sharding](../../patterns/sharding.yml) | Divide a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards. |
| [Throttling](../../patterns/throttling.yml) | Control the consumption of resources that an application instance, an individual tenant, or an entire service uses. |

## Antipatterns

Consider the [Noisy Neighbor antipattern](../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml), in which the activity of one tenant can negatively affect another tenant's use of the system.

## Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework

If you design a SaaS, use the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework workload for SaaS](/azure/well-architected/saas/) to get actionable architectural guidance that's specific to SaaS solutions.

The entirety of the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) is important for all solutions, including multitenant architectures, but pay special attention to the [Reliability pillar](/azure/well-architected/reliability/). The nature of cloud hosting results in applications that are often multitenant, use shared platform services, compete for resources and bandwidth, communicate over the internet, and run on commodity hardware. This environment increases the likelihood that both transient and more permanent faults will occur.

## Multitenant architectural guidance

- [Architect multitenant solutions on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aem8elgN7iI) (video): This video describes how to design, architect, and build multitenant solutions on Azure. If you build a SaaS product or another multitenant service, there's a lot to consider when you plan for high performance, tenant isolation, and deployment management. This session is aimed at developers and architects who build multitenant or SaaS applications, including startups and ISVs.

- [Azure Friday - Architect multitenant solutions on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nJ8UdJYU4M) (video): This video from Azure Friday describes how to design, architect, and build multitenant SaaS solutions on Azure.

- [Accelerate and de-risk your journey to SaaS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8dPAFIG1xA) (video): This video provides guidance on how to transition to the SaaS delivery model, whether you're lifting and shifting an existing solution from on-premises to Azure, considering a multitenant architecture, or modernizing an existing SaaS web application.

## Resources for Azure services

Use the following resources to help you build multitenant architectures on Azure.

### Governance and compliance

- [Organize and manage multiple Azure subscriptions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/resource-org-subscriptions): It's important to consider how you manage your Azure subscriptions and how you allocate tenant resources to subscriptions.

- [Cross-tenant management experiences](/azure/lighthouse/concepts/cross-tenant-management-experience): As a service provider, you can use Azure Lighthouse to manage resources for multiple customers from within your own Microsoft Entra tenant. Many tasks and services can be performed across managed tenants by using Azure delegated resource management.

- [Azure-managed applications](/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview): In a managed application, the resources are deployed to a resource group that the publisher of the app manages. The resource group is present in the consumer's subscription, but an identity in the publisher's tenant has access to the resource group.

### Compute

- [Best practices for cluster isolation in AKS](/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation): AKS provides flexibility in how you can run multitenant clusters and can isolate resources. To maximize your investment in Kubernetes, you must first understand and implement AKS multitenancy and isolation features. This best practices article focuses on isolation for cluster operators.

- [Best practices for cluster security and upgrades in AKS](/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security): As you manage clusters in AKS, workload and data security is a key consideration. When you run multitenant clusters by using logical isolation, securing resource and workload access is crucial.

### Networking
