# Management and governance architecture design

Management and governance includes critical tasks like:

- The monitoring, auditing, and reporting of security and business requirements.
- Implementing backup, disaster recovery, and high availability.
- Ensuring compliance with internal requirements and external regulations.
- The protection of sensitive data.

Azure provides a wide range of services to help you with management and governance. Here are a few examples:  

- [Azure Attestation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-attestation). Remotely verify the trustworthiness of a platform and the integrity of the binaries running inside it.
- [Azure confidential ledger](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-confidential-ledger). Store and process confidential data with confidence.
- [Azure Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview). Govern, protect, and manage your data.
- [Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-policy). Achieve real-time cloud compliance at scale with consistent resource governance.
- [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-stack). Place technologies and services in appropriate locations, based on your business requirements. Meet custom compliance, sovereignty, and data gravity requirements.
- [Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/backup). Define backup policies and provide protection for a wide range of enterprise workloads.
- [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery). Keep your business running with built-in disaster recovery.
- [Azure Archive Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/archive). Store rarely accessed data.
- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor). Get full observability into your applications, infrastructure, and network.
- [Azure Update Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-update-management-center/). Centrally manage updates and compliance at scale.

## Introduction to management and governance on Azure

If you're new to management and governance on Azure, the best way to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn training](/training/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online training platform. Microsoft Learn provides interactive training for Microsoft products and more.

Here are some resources to get you started:

- Learning path: [Manage information protection and governance](/training/paths/m365-compliance-information)
- Module: [Design an enterprise governance strategy](/training/modules/enterprise-governance)
- Module: [Design a solution for backup and disaster recovery](/training/modules/design-solution-for-backup-disaster-recovery)

## Best practices

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of your architectures. For management and governance best practices, see:

- [Regulatory compliance](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-regulatory-compliance)
- [Administrative account security](/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-admins)

For additional guidance, see:
