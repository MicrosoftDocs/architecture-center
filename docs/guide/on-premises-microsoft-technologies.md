# Scenarios featuring Microsoft on-premises technologies on Azure

This article describes scenarios that feature Microsoft on-premises technologies on Azure. These scenarios enable you to gain the benefits provided by the cloud when you use technologies that were historically used in a local environment. The following on-premises technologies are frequently used in Azure solutions: 
- [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-server). The foundation of the Microsoft ecosystem. It continues to power the hybrid cloud network.
- [SQL Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2019). The data platform that's known for performance, security, and availability.
- [Exchange Server](/exchange/new-features/new-features). The messaging platform that provides email, scheduling, and tools for custom collaboration and messaging service applications.
- [Active Directory Domain Services in Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/identity/whats-new-active-directory-domain-services). The service that stores information about user accounts and enables other authorized users on the same network to access it. Security is integrated with Active Directory through sign-in authentication and access control to objects in the directory.
- [Host Integration Server](/host-integration-server/what-is-his). Technologies and tools that enable enterprise organizations to integrate existing IBM host systems, programs, messages, and data with new Microsoft server applications. 

For information about solutions in which Azure services integrate with the other Microsoft cloud platforms, see these articles:
