## Microsoft Entra

### Centralized identity and access management

Microsoft Entra ID is a comprehensive, cloud-based centralized identity and access management solution that can help secure and protect AWS accounts and environments.

Microsoft Entra ID provides strong SSO authentication to almost any app or platform that follows common web authentication standards, including AWS. AWS accounts that support critical workloads and highly sensitive information need strong identity protection and access control. AWS identity management is enhanced when you combine it with Microsoft Entra ID.

AWS organizations that use Microsoft Entra ID for Microsoft 365 or hybrid cloud identity and access protection can quickly and easily deploy Microsoft Entra ID for AWS accounts, often without incurring additional costs. Microsoft Entra ID provides several capabilities for direct integration with AWS:

- Integration with AWS IAM Identity Center for enhanced security, improved user experience, centralized access control, and SSO across legacy, traditional, and modern authentication solutions.

- Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, including integration with several third-party solutions from [Microsoft Intelligent Security Association](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/intelligent-security-association) partners.

- Powerful Conditional Access features for strong authentication and strict governance. Microsoft Entra ID uses Conditional Access policies and risk-based assessments to authenticate and authorize user access to the AWS Management Console and AWS resources. 

- Improved protection against identity-based attacks via real-time detection and remediation of risky sign-ins and unusual user behavior.

- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time provisioning of specific resources. You can expand PIM to any delegated permission by controlling access to custom groups, like groups that you create for access to AWS roles.

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

When several users or roles make administrative changes, _configuration drift_ away from intended security architecture and standards can occur. Security standards can also change over time. Security personnel must constantly and consistently detect new risks, evaluate mitigation options, and update security architecture to help prevent potential breaches. Security management across multiple public cloud and private infrastructure environments can become burdensome.

Defender for Cloud Apps provides enhanced protection for software as a service (SaaS) applications. It provides the following features to help you monitor and protect your cloud app data:

- __Fundamental Cloud Access Security Broker functionality__, including shadow IT discovery, visibility into cloud app usage, enhanced protection against app-based threats from anywhere in the cloud, and information protection and compliance assessments.

- __SaaS Security Posture Management features__ that enable security teams to improve the organization's security posture.

- __Advanced threat protection__, as part of the Microsoft extended detection and response solution, which enables powerful correlation of signal and visibility across the full cyberattack chain of advanced attacks.

- __App-to-app protection__, which extends the core threat scenarios to OAuth-enabled apps that have permissions and privileges to critical data and resources.

Connecting AWS to Defender for Cloud Apps helps you secure your assets and detect potential threats by monitoring administrative and sign-in activities. You get notifications of possible brute force attacks, malicious use of privileged user accounts, unusual deletions of VMs, and publicly exposed storage buckets. Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect AWS environments from abuse of cloud resources, compromised accounts and insider threats, data leakage, and resource misconfiguration and insufficient access control. The following Defender for Cloud Apps capabilities are especially useful when you work with AWS environments.

- [Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, malicious insiders, and ransomware](/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices#detect-cloud-threats-compromised-accounts-malicious-insiders-and-ransomware). Defender for Cloud Apps anomaly detection policies are triggered when there are unusual activities performed by users in AWS. Defender for Cloud Apps continually monitors your users' activities and uses UEBA and machine learning to learn and understand the typical behavior of your users and trigger alerts on any deviations.

- [Limit exposure of shared data and enforce collaboration policies](/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices). Automate governance controls via actions like notifying users about alerts, requiring re-authentication or suspending users, making an S3 bucket private, or removing collaborators from an S3 bucket.

- [Audit activities](/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices). Connect AWS auditing to Defender for Cloud apps to get visibility into user, admin, and sign-in activities.

- [Get enhanced real-time protection for AWS](/defender-cloud-apps/proxy-intro-aad). Use Defender for Cloud Apps Conditional Access app control to block and help protect downloads of sensitive AWS data by risky users.

### Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) system that provides an intelligent and comprehensive solution for SIEM and security orchestration, automation, and response. Microsoft Sentinel provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting. It gives you a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.

You can use the AWS connectors to pull AWS service logs into Microsoft Sentinel. These connectors work by granting Microsoft Sentinel access to your AWS resource logs. Setting up the connector establishes a trust relationship between AWS and Microsoft Sentinel. You create this relationship on AWS by creating a role that gives permission to Microsoft Sentinel to access your AWS logs.

The connector can ingest logs from the following AWS services by pulling them from an S3 bucket:

|Service|Data source|
|-|-|
|[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) | [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html)|

### Recommendations

Use the Microsoft security solutions and basic AWS security recommendations to protect AWS accounts.

#### Basic AWS account security

For information about basic security hygiene for AWS accounts and resources, review the AWS security guidance at [Best practices for securing AWS accounts and resources](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices).

- Reduce the risk of uploading and downloading malware and other malicious content by actively inspecting all data transfers via the AWS Management Console. Content that you upload or download directly to resources within the AWS platform, such as web servers or databases, might need additional protection.

- Provide security for access keys by rotating the keys periodically. Avoid embedding them in code. Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys wherever possible.

- Use security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources. Implement VPC to isolate resources.

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit by using AWS Key Management Services. 

- Protect devices that administrators and developers use to access the AWS Management Console.
