This guide shows how Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft Sentinel can help secure and protect Amazon Web Services (AWS) account access and environments.

AWS organizations that use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Microsoft 365 or hybrid cloud identity and access protection can quickly and easily [deploy Azure AD for AWS accounts](../../reference-architectures/aws/aws-azure-ad-security.yml), often without additional cost.

## Architecture

This diagram summarizes how AWS installations can benefit from key Microsoft security components:

### Workflow

- Azure AD provides centralized *single sign-on (SSO)* and strong authentication through *multifactor authentication* and the *conditional access* feature. Azure AD supports AWS role-based identities and authorization for access to AWS resources. For more information and detailed instructions, see [Azure AD identity and access management for AWS](../../reference-architectures/aws/aws-azure-ad-security.yml). Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is a *cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM)* product that provides comprehensive visibility and control over permissions for any AWS identity or resource. You can use Entra Permissions Management to:

  - Get a multi-dimensional view of your risk by assessing identities, permissions, and resources.
  - Automate the enforcement of the [least privilege](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) policy in your entire multicloud infrastructure.
  - Use anomaly and outlier detection to prevent data breaches that are caused by misuse and malicious exploitation of permissions.

  For more information and detailed onboarding instructions, see [Onboard an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](/azure/active-directory/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/onboard-aws).

- Defender for Cloud Apps:
  - Integrates with the Azure AD conditional access feature to enforce additional restrictions.
  - Helps monitor and protect sessions after sign-in.
  - Uses *user behavior analytics (UBA)* and other AWS APIs to monitor sessions and users and to support information protection.

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud displays AWS security recommendations in the Defender for Cloud portal together with Azure recommendations. Defender for Cloud offers more than 160 out-of-the-box recommendations for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) services. It also provides support for regulatory standards, including Center for Internet Security (CIS) and payment card industry (PCI) standards, and for the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard. Defender for Cloud also provides cloud workload protection (CWP) for [Amazon EKS clusters](/azure/defender-for-cloud/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers?tabs=aws-eks), [AWS EC2 instances](/azure/defender-for-cloud/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-servers?tabs=features-multicloud), and [SQL servers that run on AWS EC2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction).

- Microsoft Sentinel integrates with Defender for Cloud Apps and AWS to detect and automatically respond to threats. Microsoft Sentinel monitors the AWS environment for misconfiguration, potential malware, and advanced threats to AWS identities, devices, applications, and data.

### Components

- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-cloud-apps)
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/defender-for-cloud)
- [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/microsoft-sentinel)
- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory)

### Defender for Cloud Apps for visibility and control

When several users or roles make administrative changes, a consequence can be *configuration drift* away from intended security architecture and standards. Security standards can also change over time. Security personnel must constantly and consistently detect new risks, evaluate mitigation options, and update security architecture to prevent potential breaches. Security management across multiple public cloud and private infrastructure environments can become burdensome.

[Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) is a *cloud access security broker (CASB)* platform with *cloud security posture management (CSPM)* capabilities. Defender for Cloud Apps can connect to multiple cloud services and applications to collect security logs, monitor user behavior, and impose restrictions that the platforms themselves might not offer.

Defender for Cloud Apps provides several capabilities that can integrate with AWS for immediate benefits:

- The Defender for Cloud Apps app connector uses several AWS APIs, including UBA, to search for configuration issues and threats on the AWS platform.
- AWS Access Controls can enforce sign-in restrictions that are based on application, device, IP address, location, registered ISP, and specific user attributes.
- Session Controls for AWS block potential malware uploads or downloads based on Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence or real-time content inspection.
- Session controls can also use real-time content inspection and sensitive data detection to impose *data loss prevention (DLP)* rules that prevent cut, copy, paste, or print operations.

Defender for Cloud Apps is available standalone, or as part of Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, which includes Azure AD Premium P2. For pricing and licensing information, see [Enterprise Mobility + Security pricing options](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/compare-plans-and-pricing).

### Defender for Cloud for CSPM and CWP platforms (CWPP)

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same. Defender for Cloud helps protect workloads in Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Defender for Cloud provides an agentless connection to your AWS account. Defender for Cloud also offers plans to secure your AWS resources:

- The [Defender for Cloud overview page](/azure/defender-for-cloud/overview-page) displays CSPM metrics, alerts, and insights. Defender for Cloud assesses your AWS resources according to [AWS-specific security recommendations](/azure/defender-for-cloud/recommendations-reference-aws) and incorporates your security posture into your secure score. The [asset inventory](/azure/defender-for-cloud/asset-inventory) provides a single place to view all your protected AWS resources. The [regulatory compliance dashboard](/azure/defender-for-cloud/regulatory-compliance-dashboard) reflects the status of your compliance with built-in standards that are specific to AWS. Examples include AWS CIS standards, PCI data security standards (PCI-DSS), and the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard.
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-introduction) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to [supported Windows and Linux EC2 instances](/azure/defender-for-cloud/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-servers?tabs=features-windows).
- [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to [supported Amazon EKS clusters](/azure/defender-for-cloud/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers?tabs=azure-aks).
- [Microsoft Defender for SQL](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your SQL servers that run on AWS EC2 and AWS RDS Custom for SQL Server.

### Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection

Threats can come from a wide range of devices, applications, locations, and user types. DLP requires inspecting content during upload or download, because post-mortem review might be too late. AWS doesn't have native capabilities for device and application management, risk-based conditional access, session-based controls, or inline UBA.

It's critical that security solutions reduce complexity and deliver comprehensive protection regardless of whether resources are in multicloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Defender for Cloud provides CSPM and CWP. Defender for Cloud identifies configuration weak spots across AWS to help strengthen your overall security posture. It also helps provide threat protection for Amazon EKS Linux clusters, AWS EC2 instances, and SQL servers in AWS EC2.

[Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel) is a *security information and event management (SIEM)* and *security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)* solution that centralizes and coordinates threat detection and response automation for modern security operations. Microsoft Sentinel can monitor AWS accounts to compare events across multiple firewalls, network devices, and servers. Microsoft Sentinel combines monitoring data with threat intelligence, analytics rules, and machine learning to discover and respond to advanced attack techniques.

You can connect AWS and Defender for Cloud Apps with Microsoft Sentinel. Then you can see Defender for Cloud Apps alerts and run additional threat checks that use multiple Defender Threat Intelligence feeds. Microsoft Sentinel can initiate a coordinated response that's outside Defender for Cloud Apps. Microsoft Sentinel can also integrate with IT service management (ITSM) solutions and retain data on a long-term basis for compliance purposes.

## Scenario details

Microsoft offers several security solutions that can help secure and protect AWS accounts and environments.

Other Microsoft security components can integrate with Azure AD to provide additional security for AWS accounts:

- Defender for Cloud Apps backs up Azure AD with session protection and user-behavior monitoring.
- Defender for Cloud provides threat protection to AWS workloads. It also helps proactively strengthen security for AWS environments and uses an agentless approach to connect to those environments.
- Microsoft Sentinel integrates with Azure AD and Defender for Cloud Apps to detect and automatically respond to threats against AWS environments.

These Microsoft security solutions are extensible and offer multiple levels of protection. You can implement one or more of these solutions along with other types of protection for a full-security architecture that helps protect current and future AWS deployments.

### Potential use cases

This article provides AWS identity architects, administrators, and security analysts with immediate insights and detailed guidance for deploying several Microsoft security solutions.

## Recommendations

Keep the following points in mind when you develop a security solution.

### Security recommendations

The following principles and guidelines are important for any cloud security solution:

- Ensure that the organization can monitor, detect, and automatically protect user and programmatic access into cloud environments.
- Continually review current accounts to ensure identity and permission governance and control.
- Follow least privilege and [zero trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) principles. Make sure that users can access only the specific resources that they require, from trusted devices and known locations. Reduce the permissions of every administrator and developer to provide only the rights that they need for the role that they perform. Review regularly.
- Continuously monitor platform configuration changes, especially if they provide opportunities for privilege escalation or attack persistence.
- Prevent unauthorized data exfiltration by actively inspecting and controlling content.
- Take advantage of solutions that you might already own, like Azure AD Premium P2, that can increase security without additional expense.

#### Basic AWS account security

To ensure basic security hygiene for AWS accounts and resources:

- Review the AWS security guidance at [Best practices for securing AWS accounts and resources](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices).
- Reduce the risk of uploading and downloading malware and other malicious content by actively inspecting all data transfers through the AWS Management Console. Content that you upload or download directly to resources within the AWS platform, such as web servers or databases, might need additional protection.
- Consider protecting access to other resources, including:
  - Resources created within the AWS account.
  - Specific workload platforms, like Windows Server, Linux Server, or containers.
  - Devices that administrators and developers use to access the AWS Management Console.

## Deploy this scenario

Take the steps in the following sections to implement a security solution.

### Plan and prepare

To prepare for deployment of Azure security solutions, review and record current AWS and Azure AD account information. If you've deployed more than one AWS account, repeat these steps for each account.

1. In the [AWS Billing Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account), record the following current AWS account information:
   - **AWS Account ID**, a unique identifier
   - **Account name**, or root user
   - **Payment method**, whether assigned to a credit card or a company billing agreement
   - **Alternate contacts** who have access to AWS account information
   - **Security questions**, securely updated and recorded for emergency access
   - **AWS regions** that are enabled or disabled to comply with data security policy

1. In the [Azure AD portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), review the Azure AD tenant:
   - Assess **Tenant information** to see whether the tenant has an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license. A P2 license provides [advanced Azure AD identity management](../../reference-architectures/aws/aws-azure-ad-security.yml#advanced-azure-ad-identity-management-with-aws-accounts) features.
   - Assess **Enterprise applications** to see whether any existing applications use the AWS application type, as shown by `http://aws.amazon.com/` in the **Homepage URL** column.

### Deploy Defender for Cloud Apps

After you deploy the central management and strong authentication that modern identity and access management require, you can implement Defender for Cloud Apps to:

   :::image type="content" source="media/activity-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Activity source section of the Create session policy page. A filter rule is visible for AWS apps.":::

1. Review the other settings, and then select **Create**.

#### Test Defender for Cloud Apps policies for AWS

Test all policies regularly to ensure that they're still effective and relevant. Here are a few recommended tests:

- IAM policy changes: This policy is triggered each time that you attempt to modify the settings within AWS IAM. For instance, when you follow the procedure later in this deployment section to create a new IAM policy and account, you see an alert.

- Console sign-in failures: Any failed attempts to sign in to one of the test accounts trigger this policy. The alert details show that the attempt came from one of the Azure regional datacenters.

- S3 bucket activity policy: When you attempt to create a new AWS S3 storage account and set it to be publicly available, you trigger this policy.

- Malware detection policy: If you configure malware detection as a session policy, you can test it by following these steps:
  1. Download a safe test file from the [European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus Research (EICAR)](https://www.eicar.org).
  1. Try to upload that file to an AWS S3 storage account.

  The policy immediately blocks the upload attempt, and an alert appears in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.

### Deploy Defender for Cloud

You can use a native cloud connector to connect an AWS account to Defender for Cloud. The connector provides an agentless connection to your AWS account. You can use this connection to gather CSPM recommendations. By using Defender for Cloud plans, you can secure your AWS resources with CWP.

#### Monitor AWS incidents

Microsoft Sentinel creates incidents based on the analyses and detections that you turn on. Each incident can include one or more events, which reduces the overall number of investigations that are necessary to detect and respond to potential threats.

Microsoft Sentinel shows incidents that Defender for Cloud Apps generates, if it's connected, and incidents that Microsoft Sentinel creates. The **Product names** column shows the incident source.

#### Check data ingestion

Check that data is continuously ingested into Microsoft Sentinel by regularly viewing the connector details. The following chart shows a new connection.

If the connector stops ingesting data and the line chart value drops, check the credentials that you use to connect to the AWS account. Also check that AWS CloudTrail can still collect the events.
