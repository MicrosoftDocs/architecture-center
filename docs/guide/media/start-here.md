# Media architecture design

Azure and Azure services can help you deliver high-quality video content to any device. Azure Media Services is a cloud-based platform that enables you to build solutions that achieve broadcast-quality video streaming, enhance accessibility and distribution, analyze content, and more. Gridwich, an event-processing framework for delivering media assets on Azure, was developed by Microsoft for a well-known entertainment conglomerate.

Select the following links to learn more about media services that are available on Azure:

- [Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services). Use high-definition video encoding and streaming services to reach your audiences on the devices they use. And enhance content discoverability and performance by using AI. 
- [Azure Media Player](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/media-player). Use a single player for automatic playback on the most popular devices.
- [Azure Content Delivery Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn). Deliver content on a fast, reliable network that has global reach.
- [Azure Content Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/content-protection). Use AES, PlayReady, Widevine, and FairPlay to deliver content with enhanced security.
- [Encoding](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/encoding). Implement studio-grade encoding at cloud scale.
- [Live and on-demand streaming](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/media-services/live-on-demand). Deliver content to virtually any device, with scalable streaming.

## Path to production

For a brief overview, start with [Media Services terminology and concepts](/azure/media-services/latest/concepts-overview?toc=/azure/architecture/toc.json&bc=/azure/architecture/_bread/toc.json).

## Best practices

The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can improve the security of your Azure solutions. For information that's specific to Media Services, see [Azure security baseline for Azure Media Services](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/media-services-security-baseline?toc=/azure/architecture/toc.json&bc=/azure/architecture/_bread/toc.json).

## Media architectures and solutions

The following sections, organized by category, provide links to sample architectures and other articles.

### Gridwich media processing system

Gridwich is a stateless event-processing framework created by Microsoft. It embodies best practices for processing and delivering media assets on Azure. Gridwich pipelines ingest, process, store, and deliver media assets.

For more information, see the [Gridwich cloud media system](../../reference-architectures/media-services/gridwich-architecture.yml) architecture.
