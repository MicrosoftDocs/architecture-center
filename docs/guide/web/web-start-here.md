# Web applications architecture design

Today's web apps are expected to be available all day, every day from anywhere in the world, and usable from virtually any device or screen size. Web applications must be secure, flexible, and scalable to meet spikes in demand. 

This article provides an overview of Azure web app technologies, guidance, solution ideas, and reference architectures.

Azure provides a wide range of tools and capabilities for creating, hosting, and monitoring web apps. These are just some of the key web app services available in Azure:

- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service) enables you to easily create enterprise-ready web and mobile apps for any platform or device and deploy them on a scalable cloud infrastructure.
- [Azure Web Application Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/web-application-firewall) provides powerful protection for web apps.
- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) provides full observability into your applications, infrastructure, and network. Monitor includes [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), which provides application performance management and monitoring for live web apps.
- [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service) enables you to easily add real-time web functionalities.
- [Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/static) provides streamlined full-stack development, from source code to global high availability.
- [Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers) enables you to run containerized web apps on Windows and Linux.

## Introduction to web apps on Azure

If you're new to creating and hosting web apps on Azure, the best way to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn](/learn/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online training platform. Microsoft Learn provides interactive training for Microsoft products and more. 

These are a few good starting points to consider:
- Learning path: 
   - [Create Azure App Service web apps](/learn/paths/create-azure-app-service-web-apps)
- Individual modules: 
   - [Deploy and run a containerized web app with Azure App Service](/learn/modules/deploy-run-container-app-service)
   - [Azure Static Web Apps](/learn/paths/azure-static-web-apps)

## Path to production

Consider these patterns, guidelines, and architectures as you plan and implement your deployment:
- [Basic web application](../../reference-architectures/app-service-web-app/basic-web-app.yml)
- [Common web application architectures](/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures)
- [Design principles for Azure applications](../../guide/design-principles/index.md)
- [Design and implementation patterns - Cloud Design Patterns](../../patterns/category/design-implementation.md) 
- [Enterprise deployment using App Services Environment](../../reference-architectures/enterprise-integration/ase-standard-deployment.yml)
- [High availability enterprise deployment using App Services Environment](../../reference-architectures/enterprise-integration/ase-high-availability-deployment.yml)

## Best practices
