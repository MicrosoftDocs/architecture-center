# Choose an Azure compute service

Azure provides many ways to host your application code. The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the resources that your application runs on. This article helps you choose a compute service for your application.

## Architecture

Use the following flowchart to select a candidate compute service.

:::image type="complex" border="false" source="images/compute-choices.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows a decision tree for Azure compute services." lightbox="images/compute-choices.svg":::
   The image shows a flowchart for selecting an appropriate Azure service based on whether the user is migrating an existing workload or building a new one. The flowchart begins with a Start node and splits into two primary branches labeled Migrate and Build new. The Migrate branch includes decision points that assess whether the application is optimized for the cloud and whether it can be lifted and shifted. Depending on the answers, the flow leads to services such as Azure App Service, Azure VMware Solution, or Virtual Machines. The Build new branch includes decision points that evaluate the need for full control, high-performance computing, event-driven workloads, managed web hosting, and orchestration requirements. These decisions guide the user toward services such as Virtual Machines, Azure Batch, Azure Functions, App Service, Azure Container Instances, Azure Service Fabric, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Azure Container Apps. A branching section for your own orchestration implementation on Virtual Machines includes VMware Tanzu on Virtual Machines, Kubernetes on Virtual Machines, and OpenShift on Virtual Machines. At the bottom of the image, two boxed sections list container-exclusive services and container-compatible services. The container-exclusive section includes Azure Container Instances, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes on Virtual Machines, OpenShift on Virtual Machines, and VMware Tanzu on Virtual Machines. The container-compatible section includes Azure Batch, Azure Functions, Service Fabric, and App Service.

The previous diagram refers to two migration strategies:

- **Lift and shift:** A strategy for migrating a workload to the cloud without redesigning the application or making code changes. It's also known as *rehosting*. For more information, see [Azure cloud migration and modernization center](https://azure.microsoft.com/migration).

- **Cloud optimized:** A strategy for migrating to the cloud by refactoring an application to take advantage of cloud-native features and capabilities.

The output from this flowchart is your starting point. Next, evaluate the service to see if it meets your needs.

This article includes several tables that can help you choose a service. The initial candidate from the flowchart might be unsuitable for your application or workload. In that case, expand your analysis to include other compute services.

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution can incorporate two or more compute services.

## Understand the basic features

If you're not familiar with the Azure service that you select in the previous section, see the following overview documentation:

- [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service) is a managed service for hosting web apps, mobile app back ends, RESTful APIs, or automated business processes.

- [Azure Batch](/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview) is a managed service for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

- [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps) is a managed service built on Kubernetes, which simplifies the deployment of containerized applications in a serverless environment.

- [Azure Container Instances](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview) is a service for running a single container or group of containers in Azure. Container Instances doesn't provide full container orchestration, but you can implement containers without having to provision virtual machines (VMs) or adopt a higher-level service.

- [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a service that provides managed functions that run based on a variety of trigger types for event-driven applications.

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) is a managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.

- [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](/azure/openshift) is a fully managed OpenShift cluster for running containers in production with Kubernetes.

- [Azure Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview) is a distributed systems platform that can run in many environments, including Azure or on-premises.

- [Azure VMware Solution](/azure/azure-vmware/introduction) is a managed service for running VMware workloads natively on Azure.

- [Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines) is a service where you deploy and manage VMs inside an Azure virtual network.

## Understand the hosting models

For hosting models, cloud services fall into three categories:

- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** lets you provision VMs along with the associated networking and storage components. Then you can deploy any software and applications on those VMs. This model is the closest to a traditional on-premises environment. Microsoft manages the infrastructure, and you manage the VMs.

- **Platform as a service (PaaS)** provides a managed hosting environment where you can deploy your application without needing to manage VMs or networking resources. App Service and Container Apps are PaaS services.

- **Functions as a service (FaaS)** lets you deploy your code to the service, which automatically runs it. Azure Functions is a FaaS service.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Azure Functions is an [Azure serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/#solutions) compute offering. To see how this service compares with other Azure serverless offerings, such as Azure Logic Apps for serverless workflows, see [Choose the right integration and automation services in Azure](/azure/azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs).

There's a spectrum from IaaS to fully managed PaaS. For example, Azure VMs can automatically scale by using virtual machine scale sets. This capability isn't strictly PaaS, but it resembles the management features in PaaS.

There's a trade-off between control and ease of management. IaaS provides the most control, flexibility, and portability. However, you have to provision, configure, and manage the VMs and network components that you create. FaaS services automatically manage nearly all aspects of running an application. PaaS provides partial management while requiring some user configuration.
