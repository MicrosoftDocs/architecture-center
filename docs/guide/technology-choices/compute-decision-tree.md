# Decision tree for Azure compute services

Azure offers a number of ways to host your application code. The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. The following flowchart will help you to choose a compute service for your application.

The flowchart guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation. Every application has unique requirements, so you should treat the recommendation as a starting point. Then perform a more detailed analysis, looking at aspects such as:
 
- Feature set
- [Service limits](/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- [Cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/)
- [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/)
- [Regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
- Developer ecosystem and team skills
- [Compute comparison tables](./compute-comparison.md)

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate two or more compute services.
