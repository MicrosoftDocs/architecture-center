# Choose an Azure compute service for your application

Azure offers a number of ways to host your application code. The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. The following flowchart will help you to choose a compute service for your application.

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate two or more compute services.

## Choose a candidate service

Use the following flowchart to select a candidate compute service.

![Decision tree for Azure compute services](../images/compute-decision-tree.svg)

Definitions:

- **"Lift and shift"** is a strategy for migrating a workload to the cloud without redesigning the application or making code changes. Also called *rehosting*. For more information, see [Azure migration center](https://azure.microsoft.com/migration/).
- **Cloud optimized** is a strategy for migrating to the cloud by refactoring an application to take advantage of cloud-native features and capabilities.

The output from this flowchart is a **starting point** for consideration. Next, perform a more detailed evaluation of the service to see if it meets your needs. 

This article includes several tables which may help you to make these tradeoff decisions. Based on this analysis, you may find that the initial candidate isn't suitable for your particular application or workload. In that case, expand your analysis to include other compute services.


## Understand the basic features

If you're not familiar with the Azure service selected in the previous step, read the overview documentation to understand the basics of the service.

- [App Service](/azure/app-service/). A managed service for hosting web apps, mobile app back ends, RESTful APIs, or automated business processes.
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) (AKS). A managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.
- [Batch](/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview). A managed service for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications
- [Container Instances](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview). The fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to provision any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service.
- [Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview). A managed FaaS service.
- [Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview). A distributed systems platform that can run in many environments, including Azure or on premises.
- [Virtual machines](/azure/virtual-machines/). Deploy and manage VMs inside an Azure virtual network.

## Understand the hosting models

Cloud services, including Azure services, generally fall into three categories: IaaS, PaaS, or FaaS. (There is also SaaS, software-as-a-service, which is out of scope for this article.) It's useful to understand the differences.

**Infrastructure-as-a-Service** (IaaS) lets you provision individual VMs along with the associated networking and storage components. Then you deploy whatever software and applications you want onto those VMs. This model is the closest to a traditional on-premises environment, except that Microsoft manages the infrastructure. You still manage the individual VMs.

**Platform-as-a-Service** (PaaS) provides a managed hosting environment, where you can deploy your application without needing to manage VMs or networking resources. Azure App Service is a PaaS service.

**Functions-as-a-Service** (FaaS) goes even further in removing the need to worry about the hosting environment. In a FaaS model, you simply deploy your code and the service automatically runs it. Azure Functions is a FaaS service.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Functions is an [Azure serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/#solutions) compute offering. You may read [Choose the right integration and automation services in Azure](/azure/azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs) to know how this service compares with other Azure serverless offerings, such as Logic Apps which provides serverless workflows.

There is a spectrum from IaaS to pure PaaS. For example, Azure VMs can autoscale by using virtual machine scale sets. This automatic scaling capability isn't strictly PaaS, but it's the type of management feature found in PaaS services. 

In general, there is a tradeoff between control and ease of management. IaaS gives the most control, flexibility, and portability, but you have to provision, configure and manage the VMs and network components you create. FaaS services automatically manage nearly all aspects of running an application. PaaS services fall somewhere in between.
