# Choose an Azure service for vector search

Vector search is a method of finding information stored in a database in the shape of vectors. Vectors are groups of numbers that represent features or characteristics of media, such as text or images. Vectors are a significant advancement over traditional keyword-based search methods. They offer faster, more accurate results by understanding the semantic relationships within the information.

Azure offers multiple ways to store and search vectorized data. This article helps architects and developers who need to understand and choose the right Azure service for vector search for their application.

This article compares the following services based on their vector search capabilities:

- [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL](/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/)
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/)
- [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/)

Architects and developers should compare the available services from the perspective of system requirements in [Choose a candidate service](#choose-a-candidate-service) and in [Capability matrix](#capability-matrix).

## Choose a candidate service

This section helps you select the most likely services for your needs. To narrow the choices, start by considering the system requirements.

### Key requirements

When deciding whether to use a traditional database solution or Azure AI Search service, consider your requirements and whether you can perform live or real-time vector searching on your data. A traditional relational or NoSQL database is the best fit for your scenario if you change values in vectorized fields frequently and the changes need to be searchable in real time or near real time. Likewise, using your existing database might be the best solution for you to meet your performance targets. On the other hand, if your workload doesn't require real-time or near real-time vector searchability, and you accept managing an index of vectors, AI Search can be a compelling choice.

If you choose a traditional database solution, the specific type of database service you decide to use mostly depends on your team's skill set and the databases that you currently operate. If you already use a specific type of database, like MongoDB for example, then using that same type of database might be the easiest solution for your scenario. As shown in the [Capability matrix](#capability-matrix) section, each database service has some unique capabilities and limitations for vector search. Review that information to ensure that your preferred database type supports the functionality you require.

If cost concerns are a driving factor, maintaining your existing design is likely the best fit for your scenario because introducing new services or other instances of a database service can add new net costs and complexity. Using your current databases for vector search likely affects your costs less than using a dedicated service.

If you choose to use a traditional database instead of AI Search, some advanced search features aren't available by default. For example, if you want to do reranking or hybrid search, enable that functionality through Transact-SQL (T-SQL) or other coding.

## Capability matrix

The tables in this section summarize the key differences in capabilities.

### Basic features

Native support for vector data types, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) vector indexes, vector dimension limits, multiple vector fields, and multiple vector indexes are sometimes different between the services. Your workload requirements might require some of these specific features. Understand the basic vector features of each Azure service, as shown in the following table.

### Search methods

Workloads often need to combine vector search with full text search or even a hybrid search (full text search or semantic search plus vector search). The combination of hybrid search and reranking achieves high accuracy for workloads. You can manually implement hybrid search and reranking with your own code, or you can consider how your vector store supports this workload requirement.

### Vector data indexing algorithms

Vector data indexing is the ability to efficiently store and retrieve vectors. This capability is important because indexing influences speed and accuracy of similarity searches and nearest neighbor queries on data sources.

Indexes are typically based on an exhaustive k-nearest neighbor (Ek-NN) or an ANN algorithm. Ek-NN does an exhaustive search on all data points one by one and returns the accurate *K* nearest neighbors. Ek-NN works in milliseconds with a small amount of data but can cause latency for large amounts of data.

[DiskANN](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/project-akupara-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-for-large-scale-semantic-search/), [HNSW](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Navigable_Small_World_graphs) and [IVFFlat](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) are ANN algorithm indexes. Selecting the appropriate indexing strategy involves a careful consideration of various factors such as the nature of the dataset, the specific requirements of the queries, and the available resources. DiskANN can adapt to change in the dataset and save computational resources. HNSW excels in systems that require fast query responses and can adapt to changes in the dataset. IVFFlat is effective in environments where hardware resources are limited, or query volumes aren't high.

### Similarity and distance calculation capabilities

There are [Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), [Dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product), and [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) calculation methods for vector search. These methods are used to calculate the similarity between two vectors or the distance between two vectors.

Preliminary data analysis benefits from both metrics and Euclidean distances, which allow for the extraction of different insights on data structure, whereas text classification generally performs better under Euclidean distances. Retrieval of the most similar texts to a given text typically functions better with cosine similarity.

Azure OpenAI Service embeddings rely on cosine similarity to compute similarity between documents and a query.

### Integration with Azure OpenAI and other components

When implementing vector search, you can also consider linking with other Microsoft components. For example, Azure OpenAI Service helps you create vectors for your data and input queries for vector similarity search.
