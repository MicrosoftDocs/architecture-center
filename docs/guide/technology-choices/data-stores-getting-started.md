# Prepare to choose a data store in Azure

When you prepare your landing zone environment for your cloud adoption, you need to determine the data requirements for hosting your workloads. Azure database products and services support various data storage scenarios and capabilities. How you configure your landing zone environment to support your data requirements depends on your workload governance, technical, and business requirements.

## Identify data services requirements

As part of your landing zone evaluation and preparation, you need to identify the data stores that your landing zone needs to support. This process involves assessing each of the applications and services that make up your workloads to determine their data storage and access requirements. After you identify and document these requirements, you can create policies for your landing zone to control allowed resource types based on your workload needs.

For each application or service that you deploy to your landing zone environment, use the following information as a starting point to help you determine the appropriate data store services to use.

### Functional requirements

Consider the nature of your data and how you plan to use it:

- **Data format:** Structured (tables), semi-structured (JSON, XML, and key-value), or unstructured (images and documents)

- **Purpose:** Online transactional processing (OLTP) for transactional data or online analytical processing (OLAP) for complex, ad-hoc data analysis
- **Search needs:** Indexing capability or full-text search capability
- **Specialized:** Vector stores for highly dimensional data or graph databases for highly interconnected data
- **Data relationships:** Joins, graph traversal, or hierarchical structures
- **Consistency model:** Strong, eventual, or configurable consistency
- **Schema flexibility:** Schema-on-write (rigid) versus schema-on-read (flexible)
- **Concurrency needs:** Optimistic versus pessimistic locking, and high-write scenarios
- **Data life cycle:** Short-lived versus long-term archival, and hot versus cold data
- **Data movement:** Extract, transform, and load (ETL) requirements; extract, load, and transform (ELT) requirements; and integration with pipelines

### Nonfunctional requirements

Evaluate performance and scalability expectations:

- **Latency and throughput:** Real-time versus batch processing
- **Scalability:** Vertical versus horizontal scaling, and global distribution
- **Reliability and availability:** Service-level agreement (SLA) requirements and failover strategies
- **Limits:** Storage size, throughput caps, and partitioning constraints

### Cost and management considerations

Factor in operational overhead and budget:

- **Managed versus self-hosted:** Platform as a service (PaaS) versus infrastructure as a service (IaaS) trade-offs
- **Region availability:** Data residency and compliance needs
- **Cost optimization:** Tiered storage, partitioning, and caching
- **Licensing and portability:** Vendor lock-in and open-source compatibility

### Security and governance

Ensure alignment with organizational policies:

- **Encryption:** At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Authentication and authorization:** Role-based access and identity integration
- **Auditing and monitoring:** Activity logs, alerts, and diagnostics
- **Networking:** Private endpoints, firewall rules, and virtual network integration

### DevOps and team readiness

Assess your team's ability to support and evolve the solution:

- **Skill sets:** Familiarity with query languages, SDKs, and tooling
- **Client support:** Language bindings and driver availability
- **Tooling integration:** Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and observability tools

## Key questions

Answer the following questions about your workloads to make decisions based on the Azure database services decision tree:

- **What level of control do you need over the OS and database engine?** Some scenarios require you to have a high degree of control or ownership of the software configuration and host servers for your database workloads. In these scenarios, you can deploy custom IaaS virtual machines (VMs) to fully control the deployment and configuration of data services. You might not need this level of control, but maybe you're not ready to move to a full PaaS solution. In that case, a managed instance can provide higher compatibility with your on-premises database engine while providing the benefits of a managed platform.

- **Will your workloads use a relational database technology?** If so, choose from [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview), [Azure Database for MySQL](/azure/mysql/overview), and [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/overview), which all provide managed PaaS database capabilities.  

- **Will your workloads use SQL Server?** In Azure, your workloads can run on IaaS-based [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/) or on the PaaS-based [SQL Database hosted service](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview). Your choice depends on whether you want to manage your database, apply patches, and take backups, or delegate these operations to Azure. Some scenarios require IaaS-hosted SQL Server because of capability requirements. For more information, see [Choose the right SQL Server option in Azure](/azure/azure-sql/azure-sql-iaas-vs-paas-what-is-overview).

- **Will your workloads use key-value database storage?** [Azure Managed Redis](/azure/redis/overview) is a managed in-memory data store based on the latest Redis Enterprise version. It provides low latency and high throughput. [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) also provides key-value storage capabilities.

- **Will your workloads use document or graph data?** [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a multimodel database service that supports various data types and APIs. It also provides document and graph database capabilities.

- **Will your workloads use column-family data?** [Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra](/azure/managed-instance-apache-cassandra/introduction) provides a managed Apache Cassandra cluster that can extend your existing datacenters into Azure or serve as a cloud-only cluster and datacenter.

- **Will your workloads require high-capacity data analytics capabilities?** [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/fundamentals/microsoft-fabric-overview) is an enterprise-ready, end-to-end analytics platform. It unifies data movement, data processing, ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and report building.

- **Will your workloads require search engine capabilities?** You can use [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) to build AI-enhanced cloud-based search indexes that can integrate into your applications.

- **Will your workloads use time-series data?** [Azure Data Explorer](/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) is a managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform that analyzes high volumes of data in near real time.

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure Private Link service](/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) simplifies networking design by enabling Azure services to communicate over private networking. All Azure database services support Azure Private Link service. For managed instance database services, these instances are deployed in virtual networks, so you don't need to deploy [private endpoints](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal) for them.

## Regional availability

Azure helps you deliver services at the scale needed to reach customers and partners anywhere. When you plan your cloud deployment, determine the Azure region to host your workload resources.

Most Azure regions support most database services. A few regions support only a subset of these products, but they mostly target governmental customers. Before you decide which regions to deploy your database resources to, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/) to check the latest status of regional availability.

For more information about Azure global infrastructure, see [Azure geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/).

## Data residency and compliance requirements

Legal and contractual requirements related to data storage often apply to workloads. These requirements might vary based on the location of your organization, the jurisdiction of the physical assets that host your data stores, and your applicable business sector. Consider the following components of data obligations:

- Data classification
- Data location
- Responsibilities for data protection under the shared responsibility model

For information about these requirements, see [Achieve compliant data residency and security with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/achieving-compliant-data-residency-and-security-with-azure/Achieving_Compliant_Data_Residency_and_Security_with_Azure.pdf).

Part of your compliance efforts might include controlling where your database resources are physically located. Azure regions are organized into groups called *geographies*. An [Azure geography](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/) honors data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and resiliency requirements within geographical and political boundaries. If your workloads are subject to data sovereignty or other compliance requirements, you must deploy your storage resources to regions in a compliant Azure geography.

## Establish controls for database services

When you prepare your landing zone environment, you can establish controls that limit the data stores that users can deploy. Controls can help you manage costs and limit security risks. Developers and IT teams can still deploy and configure resources that support your workloads.

After you identify and document your landing zone's requirements, you can use [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) to control the database resources that you allow users to create. Controls can allow or deny the creation of [database resource types](/azure/azure-sql/database/policy-reference?view=azuresqland&preserve-view=true).

For example, you might restrict users to creating only SQL Database resources. Use policies to control the options that users can select when they create resources. For example, you can restrict SQL Database SKUs that users can provision by allowing only specific versions of SQL Server to be installed on an IaaS VM. For more information, see [Azure Policy built-in policy definitions](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies).

You can apply policies to resources, resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups. Include your policies in [Azure Blueprints](/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) definitions, and apply them repeatedly throughout your cloud estate.
