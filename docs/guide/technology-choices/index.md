# Choose the right technologies for Azure applications

When designing a solution for Azure, there are two technology choices that you should make early in the design process, because they affect the entire architecture. These are the choice of compute and data store technologies. 

**Compute** refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. 

**Data stores** include databases that hold application or business data, but also includes data stores used for caches, IoT data, telemetry, unstructured log data, and anything else that an application might persist to storage.

This section of the Application Architecture Guide contains the following topics:

- [Compute options overview](./compute-overview.md) introduces some general considerations for choosing a compute service in Azure.
- [Criteria for choosing a compute option](./compute-comparison.md) compares specific Azure compute services across several axes, including hosting model, DevOps, availability, and scalability.
- [Choose the right data store](./data-store-overview.md) describes the major categories of data store technologies, including RDBMS, key-value store, document database, graph database, and others. 
- [Comparison criteria for choosing a data store](./data-store-comparison.md) describes some of the factors to consider when choosing a data store.
