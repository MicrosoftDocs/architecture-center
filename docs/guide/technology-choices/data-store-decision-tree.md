# Select an Azure data store for your application

Azure offers a number of managed data storage solutions, each providing different features and capabilities. This article will help you to choose a data store for your application. 

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate multiple data stores. 

Use the following flowchart to select a candidate data store.

The output from this flowchart is a **starting point** for consideration. Next, perform a more detailed evaluation of the data store to see if it meets your needs. Refer to [Criteria for choosing a data store](./data-store-considerations.md) to aid in this evaluation.
