# Ten design principles for Azure applications

Follow these design principles to make your application more scalable, resilient, and manageable.

**[Design for self healing](self-healing.md)**. In a distributed system, failures happen. Design your application to be self healing when failures occur.

**[Make all things redundant](redundancy.md)**. Build redundancy into your application, to avoid having single points of failure.

**[Minimize coordination](minimize-coordination.md)**. Minimize coordination between application services to achieve scalability.

**[Design to scale out](scale-out.md)**. Design your application so that it can scale horizontally, adding or removing new instances as demand requires.

**[Partition around limits](partition.md)**. Use partitioning to work around database, network, and compute limits.

**[Design for operations](design-for-operations.md)**. Design your application so that the operations team has the tools they need.

**[Use managed services](managed-services.md)**. When possible, use platform as a service (PaaS) rather than infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

**[Use the best data store for the job](use-the-best-data-store.md)**. Pick the storage technology that is the best fit for your data and how it will be used.

**[Design for evolution](design-for-evolution.md)**. All successful applications change over time. An evolutionary design is key for continuous innovation.

**[Build for the needs of business](build-for-business.md)**. Every design decision must be justified by a business requirement.
