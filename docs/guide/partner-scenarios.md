# Microsoft partner and third-party scenarios on Azure

This article explores Microsoft partner and third-party, non-open source scenarios on Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft partners make up a community of organizations that work with Microsoft to create innovative solutions for you. Driven by the opportunities of the intelligent cloud, Microsoft is prioritizing investments that support these opportunities.

The [Azure Sponsorship for ISVs program](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/azure-sponsorship-for-isvs#) helps independent software vendors (ISVs) use Azure services to drive platform innovation and develop new solutions that can accelerate your digital transformation. 

Visit [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) to discover, try, and deploy cloud software from Microsoft and Microsoft partners.

This article provides a summary of architectures and solutions that use Azure together with partner and third-party solutions.

We also recommend you browse our open-source solutions for Microsoft Azure:
