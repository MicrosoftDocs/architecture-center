# Mixed reality architecture design

Mixed reality is a blend of physical and digital worlds that unlocks natural and intuitive 3D human, computer, and environmental interactions. This new reality is based on advancements in computer vision, graphical processing, display technologies, input systems, and cloud computing.

The following Venn diagram illustrates the interaction between computers, humans, and the environment in mixed reality:

Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino introduced the term *mixed reality* in a 1994 paper, [A Taxonomy of Mixed reality Visual Displays](https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e77-d_12_1321). The paper explored the concept of a *virtuality continuum* and the taxonomy of visual displays. Since then, the application of mixed reality has gone beyond displays to include:

- Environmental awareness with spatial mapping and anchors.
- Human responses like hand-tracking, eye-tracking, and speech input.
- Spatial sound.
- Locations and positioning in both physical and virtual spaces.
- Collaboration on 3D assets in mixed reality spaces.

Mixed reality consists of several [types of apps](/windows/mixed-reality/discover/types-of-mixed-reality-apps?toc=/azure/architecture/toc.json&bc=/azure/architecture/_bread/toc.json):

- *Enhanced environment apps* (HoloLens only) place digital information or content in a user's current environment.
- *Blended environment apps* create a digital layer that overlays the user's space.
- *Immersive apps* create an environment that completely changes the user's world and can place them in a different time and space.

The following image shows the continuum of mixed-reality apps from physical to digital reality:

## Azure mixed reality services

Several Azure cloud services help developers build compelling mixed reality experiences on various platforms. Azure mixed reality services help people create, learn, and collaborate within their own context by bringing 3D to mobile devices, headsets, and other untethered devices. All Azure services build in comprehensive security and compliance capabilities.

- [Azure Remote Rendering](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/remote-rendering) lets you render highly complex 3D models in real time and stream them to a device. You can add Azure Remote Rendering to Unity or native C++ projects that target HoloLens 2 or Windows desktop PC.

- [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spatial-anchors) is a cross-platform service that lets you build spatially aware mixed reality applications. With Spatial Anchors, you can map, persist, and share holographic content across multiple devices at real-world scale.

- [Azure Object Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/object-anchors) is a mixed reality service that helps you create rich, immersive experiences by automatically aligning 3D content with physical objects. Object Anchors lets you gain contextual understanding of objects without the need for markers or manual alignment.

## Microsoft Learn training resources

Microsoft Learn is a free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products.

### Introduction to mixed reality

If you're new to mixed reality, the best place to learn about the ecosystem is the Microsoft Learn **Introduction to mixed reality** learning path. This learning path provides foundational knowledge about the core concepts of mixed reality, virtual reality, augmented reality, holograms, and creating 3D applications.

### Build a mixed-reality experience

If you're an intermediate-to-advanced developer with previous experience with mixed, augmented, or virtual reality, check out the **HoloLens 2 fundamentals: develop mixed reality applications**  tutorial series. With this tutorial, you can build a mixed-reality experience that lets users explore a hologram modeled after NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover. The tutorial gives you a firm grasp of the [Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)](/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk2), and shows how the MRTK can speed up your development process.
