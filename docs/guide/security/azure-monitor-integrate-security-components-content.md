This article introduces a series of articles about how to integrate security services with your IT environment to protect its systems and resources, on site and in the cloud. Microsoft provides a wide range of security services to help your organization monitor and protect your systems and information. This series of articles describes how to integrate these services with your IT environment to improve its security posture. 

Microsoft offers many documents and reference architectures about IT security. For example, you can learn about Zero Trust concepts, understand how Microsoft 365 Defender services work to protect your Office environment, and get an architectural design with various security services from Microsoft Azure Cloud. You can find a compilation of various security-oriented reference architectures on [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures](/security/cybersecurity-reference-architecture/mcra).

## Architectures in this series

This article is the first in a series of five articles that present a logical and organized way to understand and integrate the security solutions that are available from Microsoft Azure public cloud and from Microsoft 365 services. This first article provides an overview of the series. It briefly explains the content of the architecture and how it was built. The other articles in this series explain each part in more detail.

This series explores in depth the defense that you can build with these Microsoft cloud security services:

- Azure security services
- Microsoft 365 Defender Services
- Azure Monitor services

### Diagrams

This series of articles uses architectural diagrams to explain how Microsoft security services work together. The diagram in this article is the final architecture reference for this series, and it presents the whole picture. 

To make the architecture more comprehensive, it was designed to be layered onto the architecture of a typical hybrid IT environment, which in many companies has three layers:

- On-premises services, such as a private datacenter
- Office 365 services that provide Microsoft Office apps
- Azure public cloud services, including servers, storage, and identity services

At the bottom of the diagram is a layer that represents some of the most familiar techniques of attack according to MITRE ATT&CK matrix ([MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org) and the tactics involved (in blue text). From a threat perspective, malicious actors have evolved with new technologies and scenarios, especially public and hybrid clouds. 


### Articles

In addition to this introductory article, this series includes the following articles:

- [Map threats to your IT environment](../../solution-ideas/articles/map-threats-it-environment.yml)

  The second article in this series explores how you can use this architectural reference with a different set of tactics and techniques or with varying methodologies, like [the Cyber Kill Chain®](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), a framework developed by Lockheed Martin.


- [Build the first layer of defense with Azure Security services](../../solution-ideas/articles/azure-security-build-first-layer-defense.yml)

  The third article in this series explores in detail the security services of Microsoft's cloud services. It describes how to protect Azure services, like virtual machines, storage, network, application, database, and other Azure services.

- [Build the second layer of defense with Microsoft 365 Defender Security services](../../solution-ideas/articles/microsoft-365-defender-build-second-layer-defense.yml)

  The fourth article in this series explores security for Microsoft 365 services, like Office 365, Teams, and OneDrive, provided by Microsoft 365 Defender services.

- [Integrate Azure and Microsoft 365 Defender security services](../../solution-ideas/articles/microsoft-365-defender-security-integrate-azure.yml)

  The fifth article in this series explains the relationship between Azure Security and Microsoft 365 Defender services and their integration. It describes how integration works and how you can accomplish it by using Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics, which are shown on the left side of the architecture diagram. This series calls these *core monitoring services*, because the services that are depicted in the graph can work with the comprehensive services of Azure and Microsoft 365.
