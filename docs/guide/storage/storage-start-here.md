# Storage architecture design

The Azure Storage platform is the Microsoft cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios.  

The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:

- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs): A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files): Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- [Azure Queue Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/queues): A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables): A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
- [Azure Disk Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/disks): Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.

## Introduction to storage on Azure
If you're new to storage on Azure, the best way to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn](/learn/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online training platform. Microsoft Learn provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more. Check out the 
[Store data in Azure](/learn/paths/store-data-in-azure) learning path. 

## Path to production
- Choose the storage approach that best meets your needs and then create an account. For more information, see [Storage account overview](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview?toc=https:%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com/azure%2farchitecture%2ftoc.json&bc=https:%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com/azure%2farchitecture%2fbread%2ftoc.json). 

- Be sure you understand security and reliability. See these articles:
