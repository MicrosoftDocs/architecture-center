# Hardware acceleration in Azure IoT Edge Vision

Along with the camera selection, one of the other critical decisions in Vision on the Edge projects is hardware acceleration. 

The following sections describe the key components of the underlying hardware.

## CPU 

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is your default compute for most processes running on a computer. It is designed for general purpose compute. For some vision workloads where timing is not as critical, this might be a good option. However, most workloads that involve critical timing, multiple camera streams, and/or high frame rates, will require more specific hardware acceleration.

## GPU 

Many people are familiar with the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) as this is the de-facto processor for any high-end PC graphics card. In recent years, the GPU has been leveraged in high performance computer (HPC) scenarios, in data mining, and in computer AI/ML workloads. The GPU’s massive potential of parallel computing can be used in a vision workload to accelerate the processing of pixel data. The downside to a GPU is its higher power consumption, which is a critical factor to consider for your vision workload.

## FPGA 

Field Programmable Gate Arrays are reconfigurable hardware accelerators. These powerful accelerators allow for the growth of Deep Learning Neural networks, which are still evolving. These accelerators have millions of programmable gates, hundreds of I/O pins, and an exceptional compute power in the trillions of tera-MAC’s. There also many different libraries available for FPGAs that are optimized for vision workloads. Some of these libraries also include preconfigured interfaces to connect to downstream cameras and devices. One area that FPGAs tend to fall short on is floating point operations. However, manufacturers are currently working on this issue and have made many improvements in this area.

## ASIC 

Application-Specific Integrated Circuit is by far the fastest accelerator on the market today.  While they are the fastest, they are the hardest to change as they are manufactured to function for a specific task.  These custom chips are gaining popularity due to size, power per watt performance, and IP protection. This is because the IP burned into the ASIC accelerator is much harder to backwards engineer proprietary algorithms.
