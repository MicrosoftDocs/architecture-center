The [Messaging Bridge](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html) design pattern is a way to integrate disparate systems built on top of different messaging infrastructures.

## Context and problem

Message-processing systems consist of several components that work together to handle messages. Each consumes messages from a set of queues and/or topics while producing messages to a set of queues and/or topics. 

Components are bound to the messaging infrastructure via the [Message Endpoint](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageEndpoint.html). The implementation of the Message Endpoint pattern is specific to the underlying infrastrcuture, making it hard and costly to change the infrastructure. 

Even when using an abstraction layer for the messaging infrastructure, such as [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus), [MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/), or [Rebus](https://rebus.fm/what-is-rebus/), it is not trivial to switch an endpoint from technology to another. Such a change is connected with significant risk as it has to be done as a one big re-deployment of the entire system, and even then, in-flight messages need to be rerouted, moved, and have their return-address headers modified.

Many organizations end up in a situation in which their portfolio of IT systems uses multiple messaging infrastructures, e.g. by way of mergers and acquisitions. Others try to extend their current on-premises systems with cloud-hosted components for ease of maintenance, cost-effectiveness or other reasons. Yet others find themselves in a position where they need to integrate their newer systems with legacy ones that cannot be modified. Finally, there are organizations whose geographically distributed nature forces them to use multiple messaging infrastructures.

One common solution to these challenges is integration through HTTP-based web services. But this has a number of drawbacks:
- it requires the applications being integrated to be modified (by adding an HTTP client on one side and an HTTP request handler on the other)
- it requires hosting of HTTP servers, adding the complexity related to making these services secure and highly-available
- it is prone to network connectivity problems, requiring custom-build retry mechanisms

## Solution

A solution that mitigates the problems listed above is the Messaging Bridge pattern. A messaging bridge is a component that consists of two instances of the [Message Endpoint](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageEndpoint.html), one for each bridged technology. It allows messages to flow from one endpoint to the other, handling the translation between queuing technology transparently.

### Benefits

- The systems integrated via the Messaging Bridge do not have to be modified; ideally, the endpoints would not be aware that the messages are bridged.
- The message-driven integration is generally more reliable, compared to the HTTP alternative due to the at-least-once message delivery mechanism.

### Drawbacks

- Advanced features of one or both messaging technologies might not be available on the bridged route.
- The bridged route needs to consider both technologies' limitations (e.g., maximum message size may not be a problem on MSMQ but can be an issue when the bridged route leads via Azure Storage Queues).

## Issues and considerations

Consider the following points when implementing the Messaging Bridge pattern:

- If one of the integrated systems relies on the distributed transactions (e.g. via Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator, DTC) for correctness, a deduplication mechanism needs to be put in place in the bridge.

- If one of the systems being integrated does not currently use any messaging infrastructure and cannot be modified, the Messaging Bridge might be built between the infrastructure used by the other system and a SQL Server-emulated queue. The legacy system can be made to send its messages simply by inserting to a dedicated queue-table, and the bridge can take these messages and forward them to the actual messaging infrastructure.

## When to use this pattern

Use the Messaging Bridge Pattern when you need to:

- Integrate existing systems with minimal need for modification
- Integrate legacy applications that cannot be changed to use any messaging technology
- Extend existing on-premises applications with cloud-hosted components
- Connect geo-distributed systems when Internet connection is not stable
