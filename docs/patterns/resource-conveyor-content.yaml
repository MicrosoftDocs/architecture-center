# Resource Conveyor Pattern

## Overview

The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** is a cloud design pattern for efficient lifecycle management of long-running, non-managed external resources such as browser instances, external APIs, or system libraries that degrade over time. This pattern ensures optimal performance by rotating resources in a conveyor-style queue, allowing for preloading, active processing, and safe offloading without new requests.

## Problem Statement

Cloud-based applications often rely on external resources that are prone to degradation over time due to memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or long-running processes. These external resources, such as browser automation, API proxies, or containers, require proper lifecycle management to avoid performance bottlenecks or resource failures.

Existing patterns like **Bulkhead**, **Competing Consumers**, or **Circuit Breaker** help manage faults or isolate resources but do not directly address long-term degradation of non-persistent resources that need constant refreshing.

## Solution

The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** introduces a **rotational queue** that manages an array of **resource instances** at different stages of their lifecycle, ensuring efficient resource management and system resilience.

### Three Positions:

1. **Preload**:  
   In this stage, **new instances** of the resource are preloaded and prepared to enter the active pool, but they are **not yet exposed** to incoming requests. These preloaded instances are standing by to replace active resources as soon as needed.

2. **Active**:  
   **Active instances** are currently handling incoming requests. This is the **live pool** of resources that the system relies on to process tasks in real-time. The conveyor ensures that there is always a **distributed set of healthy active instances** handling the workload.

3. **Offload**:  
   Once an active instance has served its purpose or has started to degrade (but can still finish its current tasks), it enters the **offload stage**. In this stage, the instance **finishes processing any remaining work** but does not accept new requests. Once the work is complete, the instance is **terminated**, ensuring that resources are flushed out before they become a liability.

### Rotating Queue:

The conveyor mechanism **rotates resources at regular intervals**, ensuring that **preloaded instances** are regularly promoted to the **active pool**, while **offloading instances** are safely terminated after completing their work. This **continuous rotation** maintains a pool of healthy resources, preventing **performance degradation** and system slowdowns caused by long-running or degraded resources.

### Self-Healing:

The **Resource Conveyor** also introduces a **self-healing mechanism**. If an **active instance** begins to degrade but remains functional, the conveyor will eventually rotate it out of the **active pool** and into the **offload stage**, ensuring that it is safely terminated before it can further affect the system.

In cases where an **active instance completely fails** or becomes corrupted, the system should detect the failure and immediately **evict the instance** from the active pool. Upon eviction, the conveyor instantly promotes a **preloaded instance** to replace the failed resource, ensuring that requests are handled seamlessly and that there is no disruption in service.

By maintaining a **distributed array of instances** across the three stages (**Preload**, **Active**, **Offload**), the system ensures that it is always operating with a **fresh set of active resources**, while any degraded or failed instances are automatically handled without manual intervention. This approach effectively prevents **resource failures** from compromising the system's stability and ensures **continuous operation**.


## Use Cases

1. **Browser Automation**:
   - Browser instances are known to degrade due to memory leaks. By rotating browser instances in a conveyor-style queue, the system prevents degradation while handling browser-based automation tasks efficiently.

2. **API Proxy Servers**:
   - API proxies that handle large volumes of requests over time can become slow due to resource exhaustion. By rotating proxies, the system ensures optimal performance.

3. **Non-Managed Libraries**:
   - Systems that rely on external, non-managed libraries often experience slowdowns or failures over time. The conveyor ensures that these libraries are periodically recycled to avoid failures.

## Implementation

### Key Components:

1. **Preload Position**: 
   - Preloads new instances of resources before they are needed.
   
2. **Active Position**:
   - Exposes active resources to handle incoming requests.

3. **Offload Position**:
   - Ensures the current resource finishes its existing work without accepting new requests and then terminates.

### Multi-Instance Resource Conveyor Code Example

```javascript
async function rotateResources() {
  const MAX_INSTANCES = 3;
  const ROTATION_INTERVAL = 180000; // Rotate every 3 minutes (180,000 milliseconds)

  let preloadInstances = [];
  let activeInstances = [];
  let offloadInstances = [];

  // Preload initial instances
  for (let i = 0; i < MAX_INSTANCES; i++) {
    preloadInstances.push(createNewInstance());
  }

  // Function to rotate instances at intervals
  setInterval(() => {
    // Move the oldest active instance to offload
    const instanceToOffload = activeInstances.shift();
    if (instanceToOffload) {
      offloadInstances.push(instanceToOffload);
    }

    // Move the oldest preload instance to active
    const instanceToActivate = preloadInstances.shift();
    if (instanceToActivate) {
      activeInstances.push(instanceToActivate);
    }

    // Create a new preload instance
    const newPreloadInstance = createNewInstance();
    preloadInstances.push(newPreloadInstance);

    // Terminate the oldest offloaded instance after completing its tasks
    const instanceToTerminate = offloadInstances.shift();
    if (instanceToTerminate) {
      terminateInstance(instanceToTerminate);
    }

  }, ROTATION_INTERVAL);
}

// Simulate instance creation
function createNewInstance() {
  return { id: generateId(), status: "preloaded" };
}

// Simulate instance termination
function terminateInstance(instance) {
  console.log(`Terminating instance: ${instance.id} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  // Perform any necessary cleanup here
}

// Simulate ID generation
function generateId() {
  return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
}

// Start the rotation process
rotateResources();

```
### Code Description:

#### Key Steps:

##### 1. Initialization of Instances:
- Three arrays are initialized: `preloadInstances`, `activeInstances`, and `offloadInstances`, which will hold the instances in their respective lifecycle stages.
- Initially, a number of instances (defined by `MAX_INSTANCES`) are preloaded into the `preloadInstances` array.

##### 2. Rotation Logic:
- The rotation of resources is handled by a single `setInterval` function, which runs periodically based on `ROTATION_INTERVAL`.
  - The oldest active instance is moved from the `activeInstances` array to the `offloadInstances` array.
  - A new active instance is promoted from the `preloadInstances` array to replace the offloaded instance in the active pool.
  - A new instance is created and added to the `preloadInstances` array to maintain the pipeline of fresh resources.

##### 3. Termination of Offload Instances:
- After each interval, the oldest instance in the `offloadInstances` array is terminated. This ensures that the offloaded instances have completed their tasks before they are removed, maintaining system stability.

#### Core Concept:
The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** ensures that resources are continuously rotated and refreshed across three stagesâ€”**Preload**, **Active**, and **Offload**. This prevents resource exhaustion or degradation by terminating older instances after they've been safely moved to the offload stage. The key is that this process is handled by a **single interval**, making the logic simple but effective for automatic lifecycle management.


## Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Manages resource rotation automatically, preventing performance degradation over time.
- **Performance**: Maintains optimal resource performance by periodically refreshing resources.
- **Self-Healing**: Recovers from resource failures without manual intervention due to the automatic offloading and rotation of resources.
- **Modular**: Can be applied to various non-managed external resources such as APIs, browser instances, or non-native libraries in cloud environments.

## Trade-offs

- **Overhead**: The continuous rotation of resources introduces overhead, as resources must be regularly preloaded, activated, and offloaded even when not in immediate use.
- **Latency**: There may be slight latency introduced during the switch between active resources, particularly during resource-heavy operations or resource instantiation.
