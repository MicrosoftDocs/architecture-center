# Security patterns

Security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against malicious attacks on information systems (and safety assurances for attacks on operational technology systems). Losing these assurances can negatively impact your business operations and revenue, as well as your organizationâ€™s reputation in the marketplace. Maintaining security requires following well-established practices (security hygiene) and being vigilant to detect and rapidly remediate vulnerabilities and active attacks.

## Patterns

|                    Pattern                     |                                                                                                         Summary                                                                                                         |

|         [Gatekeeper](../gatekeeper.md)         | Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance that acts as a broker between clients and the application or service, validates and sanitizes requests, and passes requests and data between them. |
